# Alan OS — Master Project Registry
**Last Updated:** April 29, 2026 (Workflow 2.4 deployed + active, MMM Gmail cred reauthed, n8n-mcp + memory bank live)
**Owner:** Alan Sercy | CentPenny LLC / Veritas AI Partners
**Canonical location:** GitHub → `alan-os` repo → `PROJECTS.md`
**Session protocol:** See `SESSION_PROTOCOL.md` for the canonical open/close flow across claude.ai and Claude Code. Templates in `templates/`. Legacy: paste this file URL into Claude at session start + state environment (Host/VM) + objective.

## HOW TO USE THIS FILE
- This is the single source of truth for all active projects
- Update it at the END of every session via `push_handoff.py` or manual commit
- Claude reads this at session START — do not reconstruct from memory
- Status legend: ✅ Done | 🔨 Active | ⏳ Blocked | 🔜 Queued | ⬜ Not started

| Nimrat approval gate (3.1) | ⬜ Not started | Replace auto-send with draft-to-Nimrat flow |
| n8n auto-start Task Scheduler | 🔨 Scripts staged Apr 26 | Two PS1 scripts at `handoff/vm-scripts/` ready to paste into elevated PowerShell on VM: `01_register_n8n_autostart.ps1` (Task Scheduler entry) + `02_add_mmm_sheets_url.ps1` (writes corrected sheet ID to `.n8n\.env`). n8n filesystem writes are blocked everywhere on VM, so deploy is manual paste — see scripts in repo |
| HP Hood follow-up | 🔜 Deadline May 1 | Contact Matthew Bauer before May 1 re: full volume commitment |
| Stemilt/Gordy Schulze outreach | 🔜 Queued | Email Gordy for warm intro to Brendan — Food Shippers PS line |
| Second unpaid MMM client ($3K/mo) | ⏳ Blocked | Collection or renegotiation — unresolved |
| Workflow 2.3 Hot Lead SMS | 🔨 Skeleton built Apr 26 | Created inactive at id `AukTldfaY4oWcu1Q` — Gmail trigger on MMM inbox → reply filter → Claude classify → IF hot/warm → Twilio SMS + Gmail backup. **Blocked on:** Twilio credential (acct SID + auth token + from-number) and Loretta's mobile (E.164). Placeholders `__SET_LORETTA_MOBILE_E164__` / `__SET_TWILIO_FROM_E164__` / `__SET_TWILIO_CRED_ID__` in node "SMS Loretta". Note: trigger reuses dead Gmail cred, so will inherit 3.1's blocker |
| Workflow 2.4 Video Repurposing | ✅ Deployed + active Apr 29 | n8n ID `tX09Uxf9LdjVLmvl`. Webhook: `https://n8n.lorettasercy.com/webhook/video-repurpose`. Sheets nodes wired to cred `sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS`. **End-to-end test waiting on:** `OPUS_CLIP_API_KEY` / `BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `BUFFER_PROFILE_IDS` env on n8n VM + Loretta source video. See Workflow 2.4 detail subsection below. |

**Key contacts:** Nimrat Samra (CEO, lsercy@mmmtrucks.com) | Matthew Bauer (HP Hood) | Gordy Schulze (Stemilt)

#### Workflow 2.4 detail (deployed Apr 29)

**Status:** DEPLOYED + ACTIVE — End-to-End Test Waiting on Env Vars + Source Video

**Deploy facts:**
- n8n workflow ID: `tX09Uxf9LdjVLmvl`
- Webhook URL: `https://n8n.lorettasercy.com/webhook/video-repurpose` (POST)
- Manual trigger also wired (n8n UI Execute Workflow)
- Both Google Sheets nodes (Log Success, Log Error) use cred `sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS`
- Validator: 0 errors, 29 non-blocking warnings (typeVersion bumps + cosmetic)
- Source JSON: `workflows/workflow_2_4_video_repurposing.json`
- Notes: `workflows/workflow_2_4_notes.md`

**Pending — first real run blocked on (4 items):**
1. **`OPUS_CLIP_API_KEY`** — set in n8n VM env (Settings → Environment). Source: https://opus.pro → Settings → API.
2. **`BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN`** — set in n8n VM env. Source: Buffer developer dashboard OAuth token.
3. **`BUFFER_PROFILE_IDS`** — set in n8n VM env. Comma-separated Buffer profile IDs for Loretta's accounts.
4. **Loretta source video** — Loretta records and provides the first MP4 URL. Send via webhook POST `{video_url, video_title, platforms}`.

**Also confirm before first run:**
- `Video Log` tab exists in Content Calendar `1D7krpNO3CmuZBWfy_bN3c26FUvnv2y3JJ2gQGwRgyXM` with columns `Date | Video Title | Clips Generated | Platforms | Status | Buffer Response | Submitted At`.

**Validator-flagged future polish (optional, non-blocking):**
- Bump typeVersions: Webhook 2→2.1, HTTP Request 4.2→4.4, IF 2→2.3, Google Sheets 4.4→4.7
- Add `cachedResultName` on Sheets RL fields so the n8n UI shows the resource name
- Add `onError` handlers to HTTP / Sheets / Webhook nodes
- Tag the workflow `loretta` / `video` / `content` in the n8n UI (MCP tag-add op currently errors on this instance)

### Loretta — MoveWithClarity Content Engine
**Environment:** VM (n8n) + Host (Python triage)
**Brand:** Roots & Room — Charcoal/Sage Forest/Fresh Sage | DM Serif Display / DM Sans
**Headshot:** `cdn.lofty.com/image/fs/user-info/2026121/15/w600_original_329b765f-5c29-4c1a-9ce8-d6498e92a6c0-jpeg.webp`

#### Current System (honest audit)
| Workflow | Status | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 Weekly Content Brief | ⏳ OAuth blocked | Friction reduced Apr 26: Loretta sees 7 cols only (`Loretta Input View` filter on Content Calendar tab); `Default Status to Idea` Code node defaults blank Status so only Episode Title + Film Date are required to fire. **Now blocked on Google Sheets/Docs OAuth re-auth — see queue below.** |
| 2.2 YouTube Description Generator | ⏳ OAuth blocked | Works when creds valid; blocked on Google Sheets/Docs re-auth |
| 2.5 UTM Slug Generator | ⏳ OAuth blocked | Trigger cred + Sheets cred both revoked |
| 2.6 Content Intake Form | ⏳ OAuth blocked | Trigger cred + Sheets cred both revoked |
| C — Loretta Telegram Topic Intake | 🔨 Active, end-to-end tested Apr 26 PM | Workflow `q0aogZju1nET96kP`. Webhook URL `https://unaltered-stiffly-renewably.ngrok-free.dev/webhook/loretta-topic-intake`. Append to Content Calendar verified via exec `13476`. Telegram bot still needs `setWebhook` call to start receiving Loretta's real messages |
| Wave Report landing page `/the-wave1` | ✅ Live | Live but Loretta not using system |
| Auto-post to Instagram/YouTube | ⬜ Not built | Buffer/Publer selection pending |
| ManyChat comment triggers | ⬜ Not built | Phase 1: RELIST trigger only |
| PDF delivery automation | ⬜ Not built | Manual for Phase 1 |
| Lofty source tagging | ⬜ Not built | All leads land in one pile |
| Nurture sequences | ⬜ Not built | Phase 2 |

**OAuth re-auth queue (Apr 2026):** Three Google creds revoked refresh tokens around Apr 12–14. Re-auth must happen in the n8n web UI (Credentials → click cred → Reconnect → complete Google consent). Public REST API cannot perform the OAuth handshake.

**Apr 26 PM update:** Re-auth attempted, hit `redirect_uri_mismatch`. n8n's redirect URI is `https://unaltered-stiffly-renewably.ngrok-free.dev/rest/oauth2-credential/callback` — must be added to the Google OAuth client's "Authorized redirect URIs" in GCP Console → APIs & Services → Credentials. To find the right OAuth client: open the n8n credential edit form (Client ID is plaintext), or capture from Network tab during a "Sign in with Google" click. Workflow C's append-to-Sheet *did* succeed in test exec `13476`, suggesting `sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS` may be partially functional — verification needed after browser re-auth completes.

⚠️ **ngrok URL rotates on every restart**, breaking redirect URIs. Switch to a paid ngrok static subdomain or Cloudflare Tunnel before any further re-auth work.

| Cred ID | Name | Blocks | Apr 26 PM status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS` | Google Sheets account | 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, C, 3.2, 2.4 | Append works (exec 13476); reads/triggers unverified |
| `xkF1H9p5Q52UPPoi` | Google Sheets Trigger account | 2.5, 2.6 (trigger nodes) | Still failing |
| `gbwzaRu0ONWfhuUr` | Google Docs account | 2.1, 2.2 | Unverified |

**Note:** `CONTEXT.json` `workflows.needs_reauth` mirrors these three IDs as of Apr 28.

#### Rebuild Plan (per Infrastructure Brief Apr 25)
| Phase | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Reduce Sheet input to 2 fields | ✅ Apr 26 — Default Status node added to 2.1 (commit `912a6b9` in `loretta-os`); 10 cols hidden globally + `Loretta Input View` filter created (id `1704693960`) |
| L1 | Telegram → Sheet topic intake (Workflow C) | ✅ Apr 26 PM — built, debugged, end-to-end verified (loretta-os: `4a597f0` initial build + `2efbf53` debug fixes). Three issues fixed: telegramTrigger swapped to regular webhook (auto-registration silently failing); Parse Topic reads `$json.body.message`; append needs `columns.schema`. Webhook live at `https://unaltered-stiffly-renewably.ngrok-free.dev/webhook/loretta-topic-intake` |
| L1 | Wire Buffer auto-post | ⬜ Queued — L1 remainder |
| L1 | `/relist-guide` landing page (Phase 1 per brief) | ⬜ Session L2 |
| L2 | Lofty source tagging — 8 tags configured | ⬜ Session L2 |
| L2 | PDF delivery automation via Lofty | ⬜ Session L2 |
| L2 | ManyChat RELIST trigger | ⬜ Session L3 |
| L2 | First nurture sequence (4 emails, Relist-specific) | ⬜ Session L3 |
| L3 | Remaining guide pages (New Build, Land Trap, Divorce) | ⬜ After L2 |

**Guide content status:**

### Alan OS — Dashboard + Automation Infrastructure

| Drive integration — 6 assets | ✅ Live | Service account: `lux-automation@lux-host-493415.iam.gserviceaccount.com` |
| Claude usage panel | ⏳ Blocked on admin key | `.env` currently holds a workspace key (`sk-ant-api03-...`), not an admin-scope key — admin endpoints will reject. Loader is BOM-tolerant (line 12). Needs true `sk-ant-admin01-...` key in `ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_API_KEY` — see "Admin API key" below for creation steps. |
| Push handoff to Drive | ✅ Live | `push_handoff.py` |
| Task Scheduler (alan_os_server) | ⬜ Not started | Add auto-start at login |

| Sunday evening weekly preview | ⬜ Queued | — |
| Attachment harvester | ⬜ Queued | PDFs from known senders → folders |

**Claude Usage Setup follow-ups (Apr 25–26, 2026 session):**
1. ✅ **Workspace key rotation** — Apr 26: leaked `sk-ant-api03-s1gFMM...` / `XaB_iH...` / `pzDMW...` revoked; fresh workspace key in `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; n8n state patched across 5 workflows (6 node-parameter occurrences) via `/api/v1/workflows/{id}` PUT and verified clean.
2. **Create real admin-scope key for dashboard** — current `.env` value is a workspace key, not admin. Console → API Keys → Create Key → select **Admin** scope (requires org-admin role). Add as `ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_API_KEY=sk-ant-admin-...` to `.env`.
3. **Re-add `MMM_SHEETS_URL` to `.env`** — `outbound_campaign.py` had a hardcoded Apps Script deployment URL; it was scrubbed during the lux-os repo init. Uncomment line 4 of `.env` and paste the URL back, otherwise the script can't reach the prospect tracker.
4. **Identify AlanSercy MSN Flow purpose** — n8n workflow ID `7GEpqCGS2cP0J8wY` surfaced during the rotation (no Anthropic key, so just bystander). Likely part of the 5-account email triage stack. Confirm whether it's redundant with the Python `triage.py` scripts in `lux-os/workflows/` or doing something different.

#### Admin API key (manual creation required)
Anthropic admin-scope keys (`sk-ant-admin01-...`) cannot be minted via API — they must be created interactively by an org-admin. This is the single blocker for the Claude usage panel.

1. Open https://console.anthropic.com/settings/admin-keys (must be signed in as an Organization Admin — not just a workspace member).
2. Click **Create Key** → name it e.g. `alan-os-dashboard-admin` → confirm.
3. Copy the `sk-ant-admin01-...` value (it is shown once only).
4. On host: append to `C:\Users\aserc\.lux\.env`:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_API_KEY=sk-ant-admin01-...
   ```
5. Restart `start_alan_os.bat` and the Claude usage panel should populate.

**Scope:** Admin keys can read org-wide usage/cost across all workspaces and projects, and manage workspaces/members/keys. Treat as a higher-trust secret than workspace keys — never commit, never paste into n8n nodes.

## ROADMAP — PLANNED OS COMPONENTS (Apr 28, 2026)

### ORCH-3 — Agent-to-Agent Triggering

**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** High — unlocks fully autonomous pipeline

**Description:**
Extend ORCH-2's parallel execution engine to support automatic agent handoffs. When one workflow completes and meets defined criteria, it triggers the next agent without human intervention.

**First two targets:**
1. Workflow 3.2 prospect audit finds a gap → automatically triggers outbound sequencing agent.
2. Deal marked closed in MMM tracker → automatically triggers Operations agent to generate onboarding SOP.

**Depends on:** ORCH-2 (complete), Google Sheets webhook or polling layer.

**Next action:** Design handoff contract spec — what data passes between agents, what conditions trigger the next agent, what happens on failure.

### FinanceOS

**Status:** Backburner — do not touch yet
**Priority:** Highest long-term moat

**Description:**
AI finance agent handling nightly transaction reconciliation, revenue tracking, financial reporting, and commission calculations.

**First client (planned):** Veritas / MMM revenue stack — $6K/mo MMM + $18K catch-up + Stemilt pipeline.

**Architecture needs (deferred):** bank/transaction data source, Google Sheets or Quickbooks integration, nightly Claude API call for categorization and anomaly detection, morning summary report to Alan.

**Blocker:** Needs dedicated architecture session before any build.

**Canonical note:** Biggest commercial moat in the stack. Do not start until MMM and digital presence revenue is stable and the job search is resolved.

**Next action:** Schedule architecture session — inputs, outputs, data sources, privacy model, report format.

### Alan Sercy — LinkedIn Authority Track

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** High — feeds Veritas BD pipeline and job search simultaneously

**Description:**
B2B personal brand content engine on LinkedIn targeting PE-backed operators, startup founders, and SMB owners who need AI revenue infrastructure. Separate from Loretta's real estate content. Alan's voice: 28-year revenue executive who builds and deploys AI ops systems — not a tech vendor, a trusted advisor.

**Target audience:**
- PE-backed company operators (Series A–C)
- Startup founders needing first CRO / revenue infrastructure
- SMB owners in financial services, trucking, real estate adjacent
- Executive recruiters and hiring managers at AI-native companies

**Content pillars (3):**
1. **Revenue operations war stories** — 28 years of closes, turnarounds, lessons. Human, specific, no fluff.
2. **AI in the field** — what actually works deploying for real clients (MMM, AgentOS, real results, no hype).
3. **Executive perspective on AI** — where the market is going, what operators get wrong, what to build vs buy.

**Posting cadence:** 3× per week minimum once launched.
**Format priority:** Short-form text first (highest LinkedIn reach), video repurposing second once content rhythm is established.

**Dependencies:**
- Resume finalized (in progress — see Job Search OS)
- LinkedIn profile updated to match new Veritas positioning
- First 10 posts drafted before going live (content buffer)

**Workflow to build (Phase 2):**
- n8n **Workflow 5** — LinkedIn post scheduler from content brief
- Claude drafts posts from Alan's voice guide
- Alan reviews and approves before publish
- Performance tracking in Google Sheet

**Voice guide (to be written — session task):**
Direct, warm, and earned. Lead with the specific and earn the general. Never thought-leadership clichés. Never "AI is transforming everything." Always: here is what I did, here is what happened, here is what it means for you.

**Canonical assets:** `C:\Veritas\assets\veritas\linkedin\`

**Next action:** Update LinkedIn profile headline and About section to reflect Veritas AI Partners positioning. Draft first 3 posts.

### Veritas AI Partners — Product Waitlist Pages

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** High — captures inbound while products are built

**Description:**
Single landing page per OS vertical capturing waitlist signups. No full site needed yet. One page per product: clear one-sentence value proposition, 3 bullets on what it does, email capture form. Goes live BEFORE the LinkedIn authority track launches so traffic has a destination.

**Pages to build (in order):**
1. **AgentOS** — "AI revenue operations for real estate agents. Find more leads, follow up automatically, close faster."
2. **TradeOS** — "AI business development for trucking, HVAC, plumbing, and trades. Your pipeline runs while you work."
3. **PersonalOS** — "AI life operations for executives and family stewards. Your life runs like a business."

**Tech stack:**
- Single HTML file per product (one Claude Code session each)
- Veritas brand kit: Navy `#0B1E3D`, Gold `#C6A96A`, DM Sans + Cormorant Garamond
- Email capture via Netlify Forms (free, no backend)
- Subdomains:
  - `agentos.veritasaipartners.com`
  - `tradeos.veritasaipartners.com`
  - `personalos.veritasaipartners.com`

**MMP validation rule:**
Each page goes live BEFORE full product build begins. <10 signups in 30 days → do not build that vertical. ≥10 signups → green light to build. **Exception:** AgentOS already deployed for MMM — use as social proof on the page.

**Waitlist email sequence (3 emails, Claude drafts):**
1. **Confirmation** — "You're on the list. Here's what we're building."
2. **Week 2** — "Here's a real result from our current client."
3. **Launch** — "Early access is open. Here's your invite."

**Canonical assets:** `C:\Veritas\assets\veritas\waitlist-pages\`
**Depends on:** LinkedIn authority track (traffic source), Veritas domain DNS access (subdomain setup).

**Next action:** Build AgentOS waitlist page first — one Claude Code session, deploy to Netlify same day.

**Strategic note:** This is the MMP validation gate. No more building OS verticals without a waitlist signal first.
