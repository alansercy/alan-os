# Memory Bank — Session Log

## 2026-04-28 Setup Session
- Installed n8n-mcp MCP server pointed at n8n.lorettasercy.com
- Installed n8n-skills into ~/.claude/skills/
- Initialized memory-bank protocol in CLAUDE.md
- Workflow 3.2 passed live run this session (Google Sheets cred reconnected as loretta.keysandcommunity@gmail.com)
- Next: Verify 3.1 active, deploy 2.4

## 2026-04-28 n8n MCP Smoke + 2.4 Deploy Attempt
- What was done
  - Confirmed n8n-mcp connected via mcp__n8n-mcp__n8n_health_check (status ok, v2.48.3, https://n8n.lorettasercy.com)
  - Read N8N_API_KEY from User env via PowerShell [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable (267 chars, JWT iat 1777219215 / ~2026-04-26)
  - Same JWT is also configured in ~/.claude.json under mcpServers.n8n-mcp.env.N8N_API_KEY
  - Hit https://n8n.lorettasercy.com/api/v1/workflows with X-N8N-API-KEY header → HTTP 401 {"message":"unauthorized"} (Cloudflare-fronted)
  - Called mcp__n8n-mcp__n8n_list_workflows → AUTHENTICATION_ERROR (same key, same failure)
  - Added .env, .env.*, !.env.example to .gitignore
- What worked
  - MCP transport (stdio + npx n8n-mcp) and the tool registry — non-auth endpoints respond fine
  - Local env var plumbing — key is reachable from both the host and the MCP child process
- Blockers
  - n8n public REST API rejects the current JWT on both direct curl and MCP — key is stale/rotated server-side, not a header issue
  - Cannot verify 3.1 (r1pkTZ94DuuWrTtA) active state, cannot deploy or activate 2.4 until a fresh key is issued
  - Will not auto-read C:\Users\aserc\.lux\.env for a fresher key — standing CLAUDE.md rule requires asking first on .lux/credentials
- Next step
  - Alan: in n8n UI → Settings → API → rotate/copy a fresh API key, then `setx N8N_API_KEY "<new>"` and update ~/.claude.json mcpServers.n8n-mcp.env.N8N_API_KEY
  - On next session: re-run list_workflows, verify 3.1 active (activate via n8n_update_partial_workflow activateWorkflow op if not), then deploy 2.4 via n8n_create_workflow with PLACEHOLDER_GOOGLE_SHEETS swapped to sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS on both Google Sheets nodes (success + error log), then activate 2.4
  - Pre-deploy reminder: also reconnect creds sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS, xkF1H9p5Q52UPPoi, gbwzaRu0ONWfhuUr; set OPUS_CLIP_API_KEY / BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN / BUFFER_PROFILE_IDS env on the n8n VM; create "Video Log" tab in Sheet 1D7krpNO3CmuZBWfy_bN3c26FUvnv2y3JJ2gQGwRgyXM

## 2026-04-28 Concurrent Session — Rule Relax + Server Restart
- What was done
  - Per Alan this session, relaxed the CLAUDE.md credential/.lux confirmation rule (removed "Ask before any action that touches it" from line 18)
  - Read `.lux\.env` and confirmed `N8N_API_KEY` byte-for-byte matches the User env-var — no fresher key hiding there
  - Ran `schtasks /Run /TN AlanOS_Server`; task was already running, dashboard responds 200 on `/` (117 B) and `/dashboard` (28.5 KB)
  - This session's MCP boot did NOT include `mcp__n8n-mcp__*` tools — used REST directly. n8n-mcp registration is per-session.
- What worked
  - Independent confirmation of the 401 blocker (different MCP state, same outcome → key really is rotated server-side, not a transport issue)
- Blockers
  - Same n8n 401 — see entry above
- Next step
  - Same as above (Alan rotates the n8n API key); then `setx N8N_API_KEY` + update both `.lux\.env` and `~/.claude.json` so MCP and dashboard pick up the new value

## 2026-04-29 n8n Key Rotated — Auth Restored
- What was done
  - Read N8N_API_KEY from User env (new JWT, iat 1777470745 / 2026-04-29, ends `...ybaE`)
  - Verified ~/.claude.json `projects['C:/Veritas/repos/alan-os'].mcpServers.n8n-mcp.env.N8N_API_KEY` already holds the new key (matches env exactly)
  - Direct REST: `curl https://n8n.lorettasercy.com/api/v1/workflows` → HTTP 200, 15 workflows returned
  - **3.1 (r1pkTZ94DuuWrTtA) is ACTIVE** — no activation needed
  - Other live: 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, C, AlanSercy MSN Flow, Daily Email Digest, AlanSercy Gmail, Telegram Callback Handler
  - Inactive: 2.3 (AukTldfaY4oWcu1Q), 2.4 not yet deployed, 3.2 (VvHYTjheeecJ441F currently inactive — was active during 04-28 live run, may need re-toggle), 2 stub workflows
- Blockers
  - Current MCP child process still has the old key in its spawn-time env (`mcp__n8n-mcp__n8n_list_workflows` still returns AUTHENTICATION_ERROR). File-side fix is correct; needs Claude Code session restart to refresh the MCP env.
  - 2.4 deploy not executed this turn — defer to next session so MCP can do it cleanly via `n8n_create_workflow` rather than raw REST POST
- Incident note
  - First attempt to update ~/.claude.json via PowerShell pipeline used `ConvertFrom-Json -Depth 100`, which doesn't exist in PS5.1 — pipeline produced empty `$json`, my `WriteAllText` zeroed the file. Restored from `.claude.json.bak-20260429` (taken pre-mutation, 30385 B). Backup since deleted. Pre-write backup is now the standing pattern for any mutation of `.claude.json`.
- Next step
  - Restart Claude Code so n8n-mcp respawns with new env; then run `n8n_list_workflows` → expect success
  - Then deploy 2.4: `n8n_create_workflow` from `workflows/workflow_2_4_video_repurposing.json` with PLACEHOLDER_GOOGLE_SHEETS → `sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS` on both Sheets nodes; activate via partial-update
  - Also worth re-checking 3.2 active state — it shows inactive on the wire, may need a UI toggle

## 2026-04-29 Workflow 2.4 Deployed + Activated
- What was done
  - MCP respawned with fresh JWT — `n8n_health_check` ok (n8n-mcp 2.49.0), `n8n_list_workflows` returned 15 entries
  - Built node + connection payload from `workflows/workflow_2_4_video_repurposing.json`, swapped `PLACEHOLDER_GOOGLE_SHEETS` → `sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS` on both Google Sheets nodes (Log Success, Log Error)
  - `n8n_create_workflow` succeeded → new ID **`tX09Uxf9LdjVLmvl`**, 15 nodes
  - `n8n_validate_workflow` → valid: true, 0 errors, 29 warnings (all non-blocking: outdated typeVersions, missing onError handlers, missing cachedResultName on RL fields, optional-chaining notices, long-chain note)
  - `n8n_update_partial_workflow` activateWorkflow → `active: true` confirmed via `n8n_get_workflow` minimal
- What worked
  - MCP create-then-activate path (no need for raw REST). `n8n_create_workflow` accepts `name/nodes/connections/settings` only — `active`, `tags`, `meta`, `id` are stripped per the standing PUT-strip rule and applied via partial update
- Blockers / caveats
  - `addTag` operations all failed with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase')` — tags array is empty on the workflow. n8n likely needs the tag entities to exist first; deferred (cosmetic, not functional)
  - Validator warnings to address later if desired: bump Webhook 2→2.1, HTTP Request 4.2→4.4, IF 2→2.3, Google Sheets 4.4→4.7; add `cachedResultName` on RL fields so the n8n UI dropdowns show the resource name instead of "Choose..."; add `onError` handlers
  - Pre-runtime requirements still outstanding: reauth Google creds `sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS` / `xkF1H9p5Q52UPPoi` / `gbwzaRu0ONWfhuUr`; set `OPUS_CLIP_API_KEY` / `BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `BUFFER_PROFILE_IDS` env on the n8n VM; create the `Video Log` tab in Sheet `1D7krpNO3CmuZBWfy_bN3c26FUvnv2y3JJ2gQGwRgyXM`
- Next step
  - Re-toggle 3.2 (`VvHYTjheeecJ441F`) active if Alan still wants it live
  - First end-to-end test of 2.4: hit webhook `https://n8n.lorettasercy.com/webhook/video-repurpose` with `{video_url, video_title, platforms}` — only after the OAuth + env-var prerequisites are in place
  - Optional cleanup pass: typeVersion bumps + cachedResultName on RL fields

## 2026-04-29 Verify 2.4 + Trim CLAUDE.md Reauth List
- What was done
  - Fresh-session sanity check after MCP respawn: `n8n_list_workflows` returned 16 entries (auth healthy)
  - `n8n_get_workflow tX09Uxf9LdjVLmvl mode=full` confirmed both Google Sheets nodes carry credential id `sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS` ("Google Sheets account") — no PLACEHOLDER strings present, `active=true`, activation event recorded 2026-04-29T14:16:47.719Z
  - Idempotent — no `update_partial_workflow` needed; deploy from the parallel 2026-04-29 session is intact
  - CLAUDE.md: removed `sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS` from the needs-reauth list and updated 2.4 line to `tX09Uxf9LdjVLmvl — Loretta video repurposing (deployed + active 2026-04-29)`. Subsequent linter/user pass cleared the remaining two creds (`xkF1H9p5Q52UPPoi`, `gbwzaRu0ONWfhuUr`) — needs-reauth list is now empty
- What worked
  - Reading current state via `n8n_get_workflow` before mutating saved an unnecessary update call — pattern worth keeping for any "deploy if not already deployed" task
- Blockers
  - Pre-runtime gates for 2.4 still open: `OPUS_CLIP_API_KEY` / `BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `BUFFER_PROFILE_IDS` on the n8n VM, and the `Video Log` tab in Sheet `1D7krpNO3CmuZBWfy_bN3c26FUvnv2y3JJ2gQGwRgyXM`
  - 3.2 (`VvHYTjheeecJ441F`) still shows `active=false` on the wire — unchanged this session
- Next step
  - First end-to-end run of 2.4 once env vars + Sheet tab are in place
  - Decide whether to re-toggle 3.2 active

## 2026-04-29 N8N API Key Rotation + 3.1 Verification
- What was done
  - User rotated n8n API key in UI and persisted to User-scope env (`setx`); new JWT has jti `437d9b01-093d-4f64-82e7-6819e1998bff`, iat `1777470745`, replacing prior `e5d6b857...` / iat `1777219215`
  - Wrote new key to `C:\Veritas\repos\alan-os\.env` (new file, 281 bytes; `.env` already in `.gitignore`)
  - Updated `C:\Users\aserc\.lux\.env` — preserved existing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` line, added `N8N_API_KEY`
  - Updated `C:\Users\aserc\.claude.json` at `mcpServers.n8n-mcp.env.N8N_API_KEY` via literal substring replace (single occurrence verified before write); JSON re-parsed clean post-write; backup `.bak-20260429` was created during write but was cleaned up afterward (Claude Code rewrites `.claude.json` continuously on session metadata — file remained intact)
  - Live API verified: `GET https://n8n.lorettasercy.com/api/v1/workflows?limit=1` → 200 with new key
  - Workflow 3.1 (`r1pkTZ94DuuWrTtA` MMM Trucking Gmail Triage) confirmed `active=True`, Schedule Trigger; last 5 executions all `success`, 2-hour cadence — latest `2026-04-29T02:00:00Z` clean. No reactivation needed.
  - Video Log tab created in Loretta Content Tracker Sheet `1D7krpNO3CmuZBWfy_bN3c26FUvnv2y3JJ2gQGwRgyXM` (new sheetId `915616600`) via service account `lux-automation@lux-host-493415` with header row `Date | Video Title | Clips Generated | Platforms | Status | Buffer Response | Submitted At` (done in prior turn this session)
- What worked
  - `[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('N8N_API_KEY','User')` correctly reads the registry-persisted value across fresh PowerShell shells without inheriting stale env from parent
  - Literal-string Replace on the JWT (no regex) — safer than re-serializing JSON; preserved file structure exactly
  - Service account remains the cleanest path for direct Sheet edits from the host (no OAuth handshake needed)
- Blockers
  - Workflow 2.4 deploy still pending: needs (1) `OPUS_CLIP_API_KEY` / `BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `BUFFER_PROFILE_IDS` env vars on the n8n VM (cannot be verified from host), (2) the three Google credential reauths (`sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS`, `xkF1H9p5Q52UPPoi`, `gbwzaRu0ONWfhuUr`)
  - Note: `C:\Users\aserc\.lux\.env` still carries the revoked `pzDMW...` Anthropic workspace key — separate rotation owed (per PROJECTS.md line 227)
- Next step
  - Set the three env vars on the n8n VM (Settings → Environment, or `.n8n\.env` directly)
  - Reconnect the three Google creds in n8n UI
  - Then deploy Workflow 2.4: POST `workflows/workflow_2_4_video_repurposing.json` with `PLACEHOLDER_GOOGLE_SHEETS` swapped to `sG8kOyb5bJb0hjgS` on both Sheets nodes; activate; smoke-test with a short MP4 URL

## 2026-04-29 SalesOS Phase 1 — Schema + API + Specs
- What was done
  - Created `C:\Users\aserc\.lux\data\leads.json` (`{leads: [], schema_version: "1.0", last_updated: ""}`) and `C:\Users\aserc\.lux\data\competitors.json` (`{competitors: [], schema_version: "1.0"}`)
  - Added 5 SalesOS endpoints to `C:\Users\aserc\.lux\workflows\alan_os_server.py`: `GET /leads` (filterable owner/pipeline/stage), `POST /leads` (auto-uuid + timestamps + enum validation on owner/pipeline/stage/source), `PATCH /leads/{id}` (whitelisted patchable fields, bumps `updated_at`), `GET /leads/pipeline` (registered before any `/leads/{id}` route, returns `{stages, grouped, counts, total}` for kanban), `GET /competitors` (optional pipeline filter). Helpers `read_wrapped` / `write_wrapped` added since the wrapped-object schema doesn't fit the existing `read_json`/`write_json` (those expect a bare array)
  - Specs written (build-not-yet): `C:\Veritas\repos\alan-os\docs\workflow_4_1_spec.md` (n8n lead enrichment workflow — Anthropic HTTP Request per CLAUDE.md §2 rules, two trigger modes, POST-to-/leads + email summary), `C:\Veritas\repos\alan-os\docs\salesOS_dashboard_spec.md` (kanban tab spec backed by the new endpoints, drawer-based stage transitions for Phase 1, drag-drop deferred to Phase 2)
  - Smoke-tested all 5 endpoints end-to-end — POST creates lead with uuid, GET filters work, PATCH transitions stage, kanban groups correctly, invalid `owner` returns HTTP 400. Cleaned up smoke-test row, leads.json back to empty
- What worked
  - Inserted new section between `/digest` and `/dashboard` routes — clean isolation from existing array-shaped data files. Validation errors (Pydantic + manual enum checks) return 400, not 422, matching the existing `/projects` HTTPException pattern
  - Pre-validated parse with `ast.parse` against `utf-8-sig` — file has a BOM at byte 0, so plain `utf-8` parse fails noise-only. Worth knowing: alan_os_server.py is BOM-prefixed (the existing `.env` loader on line 25 already handles this with `encoding="utf-8-sig"`)
- Blockers / caveats
  - **Restart trap (FIXED later this session):** original `/admin/restart` issued `schtasks /End` + `/Run` — `/End` did NOT kill the orphaned uvicorn (PID 29404). The `/Run` failed with Last Result 1 (port 8000 bound) and the OLD code kept serving. Had to `Stop-Process -Force` manually. See "/admin/restart fix" entry below.
  - n8n VM -> host (`localhost:8000`) reachability for Workflow 4.1 Step 4 is unverified — flagged as an open question in `workflow_4_1_spec.md`. Three resolution options listed (ngrok / `/admin/write-file` direct / move alan-os to VM)
- Next step
  - Decide host-VM connectivity for 4.1 before building the workflow
  - Build SalesOS dashboard tab per `docs/salesOS_dashboard_spec.md` once the connectivity question is resolved (so the "New Lead" modal has a backing path)

## 2026-04-29 /admin/restart fix — proper self-restart
- What was done
  - Replaced `schtasks /End`-based handler with a detached helper subprocess pattern: spawn `cmd /c` with `DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, helper waits ~2s, `taskkill /F /PID <self>`, waits ~1s, `schtasks /Run /TN AlanOS_Server`. Endpoint returns the response synchronously before the kill fires.
  - Edited `C:\Users\aserc\.lux\workflows\alan_os_server.py` `restart_server()` (single-function change, no other touches)
- What worked
  - End-to-end test verified live: BEFORE_PID 11720 → response returned `{status:ok, pid:11720, message:...}` → AFTER_PID 9108 ~6s later → new server serves `/` (200) and `/leads` (count=0, schema_version=1.0). PID actually changed; SalesOS endpoints survived the restart
  - `ping -n N 127.0.0.1 >nul` as the sleep mechanism — `timeout.exe /t` requires a console (it errors with "Input redirection is not supported" in a detached process). `ping` has no console requirement and is built-in everywhere
- Blockers
  - None. The endpoint is now idempotent and self-contained — code changes to alan_os_server.py can be deployed by `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/admin/restart` from anywhere
- Next step
  - Commit the SalesOS Phase 1 work (alan-os: docs + memory-bank) and the lux-os work (alan_os_server.py + data/leads.json + data/competitors.json) — separate commits, separate repos

## 2026-04-29 Desktop Inventory + Org Plan (report-only, on hold pending backup)
- What was done
  - Scanned `C:\Users\aserc\Desktop` — 24 folders + 40 top-level files, ~480GB total (dominated by `Personal Desktop\` at 477GB and `Capcut\` at 1.2GB)
  - Produced grouped inventory + recommended org plan: keep ~10 launcher `.lnk` shortcuts on Desktop; redistribute everything else to `C:\Veritas\assets\{loretta,mmm,veritas,sanmiguel,dominick}\`, `C:\Veritas\repos\alan-os\docs\` (for `agentOS_build_plan.docx`, `East-of-Dallas-AgentOS-SOP.docx`, `CLAUDECODE.md.txt`), `C:\Veritas\archive\` (Rockop Work, TA Services, 2024 Resume, alan_os_phase2_backend + .zip, AutoRecovery duplicates), and `Personal Desktop\` (absorbs personal items already on top level)
  - Per CLAUDE.md rule, nothing recommended for `.lux\` — that directory stays as-is
  - Deletion candidates flagged: `New folder\` + `__New folder\` (both contain identical `BlueStacksBackup_1370806923`), `desktop.ini`, `___All_Errors.txt`, broken `.lnk` (empty filename), `Shortcut to Desktop (OneDrive - Personal).lnk` (self-referential), the `Apps\` folder of duplicate launcher shortcuts
  - **PRIORITY SENSITIVE: `AWS New Biz Photos\`** contains `DL.jpg` (driver's license) and `SS Card.jpg` (Social Security card) plus LinkedIn headshots. Currently sitting unencrypted on Desktop. Recommend encrypted relocation (Proton Drive, BitLocker volume, or 7-Zip AES archive). Do NOT include in any synced/asset folder as-is.
  - Other notable findings: `Alan AI Stack\Veritas AI Partners\` is an empty stub (28K total, four empty subfolders) superseded by `C:\Veritas\repos\`; `alan_os_phase2_backend\` + `.zip` are likewise superseded; `Capcut\` (1.2GB) is the source media for workflow 2.4 video repurposing — belongs under `assets\loretta\`
- What worked
  - `du -sh` on suspect folders surfaced the 477GB `Personal Desktop\` immediately — cleanup blast radius is dominated by that single folder, so any move plan must sequence around it
  - Reading inside `Alan AI Stack\` (28K total) confirmed it's an empty scaffolding folder, not a parallel doc source
- Blockers
  - **Cleanup is on hold pending backup.** No moves, no deletes until Alan confirms a full-disk backup exists. Especially critical given the 477GB `Personal Desktop\` blob and the unencrypted DL/SSN images.
  - Some folders need investigation before a final decision: `Turks Photos\` (appeared empty in listing — verify), `Sanmiguel Painting Co\` (active client deliverable or one-off handoff?), `Alan AI Stack\AI Vault\inbox_dashboard.md` (single file — confirm nothing in `.lux\` reads it before deleting parent stub)
- Next step
  - Alan: confirm/run full backup before any Desktop mutation
  - Then: I draft a PowerShell move script with `-WhatIf` first, scoped to one category at a time (suggest order: archive folder first → Veritas assets → personal absorption → deletions last)
  - Handle `AWS New Biz Photos\` separately and first — encrypted destination of Alan's choice, then verify-and-shred the original

## 2026-04-29 Claude Code Statusline Wired — Live Token/Cost Display
- What was done
  - Wrote `C:\Users\aserc\.claude\statusline.ps1` — PowerShell script reading the official statusline stdin schema (snake_case nested: `model.display_name`, `context_window.used_percentage`, `context_window.total_input_tokens` + `total_output_tokens`, `cost.total_cost_usd`, `cost.total_duration_ms`, `rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}.used_percentage`)
  - Output is two lines: `[Model] dir | branch` then `[bar] pct% | NK tok | $cost | duration | rate limits`. Bar is green/yellow/red at 0-69/70-89/90+ thresholds. ASCII-only (no emojis, no unicode blocks) for Windows terminal compatibility. Rate limits gracefully omitted when absent (non-Pro/Max sessions)
  - Updated `C:\Users\aserc\.claude\settings.json` to add `statusLine` block: `{"type":"command","command":"powershell -NoProfile -File C:/Users/aserc/.claude/statusline.ps1","padding":1}`
  - Pre-write backup: both files copied to `C:\Veritas\archive\backups\2026-04-29\` (CLAUDE.md 5415B, settings.json 248B — pre-modification)
- What worked
  - Verified disk reality before implementing — research agent had given a guessed camelCase schema (`contextUsage.inputTokens`) that doesn't match the real Claude Code schema. Authoritative source is `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline`. Confirmed `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` does NOT exist (research agent claim was wrong). Confirmed transcripts at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<sessionId>.jsonl` DO carry per-message `.message.usage` blocks with `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens` — so cross-session aggregation IS possible
  - Tested two mock payloads (low pct + rate limits, high pct without) — both rendered correctly. Caught a PS5.1 silent-fail: `'{0:D2}' -f` on a `[double]` returns empty string under `$ErrorActionPreference='SilentlyContinue'`. Fix: cast to `[int]` before format. Worth remembering for any PS5.1 number formatting
- Blockers
  - Statusline updates are debounced 300ms and only fire after assistant messages / permission changes / vim toggles — won't update during long-running tool calls. Acceptable for v1
  - First-time activation may require accepting the workspace-trust dialog; if you see "statusline skipped · restart to fix", restart Claude Code
- Next step
  - **NEXT PRIORITY: build "Claude Usage" dashboard card on the Automation tab** (spec is in this session's report, not yet committed to a docs file). Backend: add `GET /claude/usage?range=today|week|live` to `C:\Users\aserc\.lux\workflows\alan_os_server.py`. Aggregate `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` assistant-message `usage` blocks, group by `.timestamp` date and `.message.model`. Live session = latest-modified `.jsonl` (or cross-ref `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` `status:"busy"`). Cache 30s (mirror `_n8n_cache`). Pricing must be a configurable JSON, not hardcoded — flag as estimated cost in UI. Frontend: card on Automation tab with 4 tiles (Live, Today, Week, Sparkline 14d). Polls `/claude/usage` every 30s while tab visible. Effort: 3-4 hours. Out of scope for v1: real-time deltas (would need a hook), authoritative cost (no Anthropic usage API for Claude Code), per-project breakdown
  - When `/usage` actually used, capture a sample `stats-cache.json` if one materializes — current claim is the file doesn't exist, but `/usage` slash-command output may write it on first invocation

## 2026-04-29 daily_burn_rate.py + /health wiring
- What was done
  - Wrote `C:\Users\aserc\.lux\workflows\daily_burn_rate.py` — walks `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl`, sums `message.usage` blocks per UTC date for the rolling 7-day window, returns dict with `today_billable`, `window_billable_so_far`, `avg_daily_billable`, `projected_window_total`, `window_days_elapsed/remaining`, `by_day`, `top_projects`. 30s in-memory cache, no network calls, importable + runnable
  - Wired into `/health` endpoint: top-of-file try-import (graceful fallback if module missing), call `_get_claude_burn()` inside `health()` and add `claude_burn` key to the response
  - Both files committed in this session's lux-os push
- What worked
  - Live `/health` smoke test after `/admin/restart`: today_billable=3.76M, window_billable_so_far=14.5M, avg_daily=2.91M, projected_window_total=23.5M (4 active days × 2.91M + 3.08 days remaining). 29 transcript files scanned, 0 parse errors. Cache observed to dedupe consecutive calls
  - Reused the JSONL-parsing logic from the ad-hoc burn-rate script earlier this turn — single source of truth now lives in workflows/
- Blockers
  - None for the burn-rate logic itself
  - **Plan ceiling unknown** — daily_burn_rate.py emits raw token counts only. Translating to "% of plan ceiling" still blocked on (a) knowing which Claude plan tier is active and (b) the dashboard's Claude Usage panel which is itself blocked on the admin API key (PROJECTS.md line 233). Workaround: the user can manually pair the projected_window_total with their plan tier's published ceiling
- Next step
  - When admin API key lands, add a second function `get_official_usage()` calling Anthropic's admin endpoint and reconcile against local transcript sum to detect drift
  - Optional: surface `claude_burn` on a dashboard card — cheap because the data is already in `/health`

## 2026-04-29 Task Scheduler Patch — Blocked on Elevation
- What was done
  - Inspected existing `AlanOS_Server` task XML: 4/7 of the desired spec already correct (LogonTrigger, restart-on-failure, IgnoreNew single-instance, runs `python.exe alan_os_server.py`). Three deltas vs. "background, no console window": missing `<Hidden>true</Hidden>`, `<ExecutionTimeLimit>P1D</ExecutionTimeLimit>` (24h cap), both battery flags `true`
  - Built patched XML at `C:\Users\aserc\.lux\workflows\AlanOS_Server.xml.patched` (Hidden=true, battery flags=false, ExecTimeLimit=PT0S). Backup at `AlanOS_Server.xml.bak` (gitignored as `*.bak`). XML schema-verified in PowerShell before registering
  - Tried three registration paths from non-elevated PowerShell: `schtasks /Create /XML /F`, `Register-ScheduledTask -Force`, `Set-ScheduledTask`. All three returned "Access is denied"
- What worked
  - The patched XML is correct — verified by re-parsing it post-write with a separate XmlNamespaceManager and asserting all four fields. Ready to apply once an elevated shell runs the registration
- Blockers
  - **Live task config unchanged.** Just confirmed via fresh `schtasks /Query /XML`: `Hidden=<missing>`, `ExecTimeLimit=P1D`, `DisallowStartIfOnBatteries=true`, `StopIfGoingOnBatteries=true`. Patch has NOT been applied
  - Claude Code session is non-elevated (`IsInRole(Administrator) = False`). Modifying tasks at `\AlanOS_Server` requires admin regardless of which API path
- Next step
  - **Alan: run elevated PowerShell once.** The exact one-liner sequence (apply + kill old python + /Run + verify hidden) was provided in this session's conversation; the file path to register from is `C:\Users\aserc\.lux\workflows\AlanOS_Server.xml.patched`. Verification target: live XML query shows `Hidden=true` AND new python.exe has empty `MainWindowTitle`/`MainWindowHandle=0`. Until this is done, server still pops a console window on login and dies after 24h
  - Alternatively: restart Claude Code as admin and ping me — I'll re-run from this side

## 2026-04-29 Session Closeout
- Net delivered today (committed + pushed across two repos):
  - SalesOS Phase 1: schema (`leads.json`, `competitors.json`), 5 endpoints (`GET /leads`, `GET /leads/pipeline`, `POST /leads`, `PATCH /leads/{id}`, `GET /competitors`), workflow 4.1 spec, dashboard tab spec
  - `/admin/restart` self-restart bug fixed (detached helper, ping-as-sleep, taskkill)
  - `daily_burn_rate.py` + `/health` `claude_burn` block (live, 30s cached)
  - alan-os CLAUDE.md tightened (memory bank reads precede skill invocations) — separate parallel-session commit `ee3571e`
  - Statusline wired at `~/.claude/statusline.ps1` referenced from `~/.claude/settings.json` (parallel-session work, not this Claude Code session)
- Carry-forward (next session must address):
  1. **Run elevated `schtasks /Create /XML /F` with the patched file** — Task Scheduler patch unfinished
  2. **`/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official`** — pre-flight done, install user-invoked only; after install, audit plugin's CLAUDE.md / skills / hooks against this repo's existing protocols before any merge
  3. **n8n VM ↔ host reachability for Workflow 4.1 Step 4** — open question in `docs/workflow_4_1_spec.md` (3 resolution options listed)
  4. **Admin API key creation** — single biggest dashboard gap (PROJECTS.md line 233); unblocks both Claude Usage panel and SalesOS-vs-plan-ceiling math
- Burn-rate snapshot at close: 14.5M billable / 7-day window, day 3.92 of 7, projected end-of-window ~23.5M

## 2026-04-29 VIE — Stub Captured (description TBD)
- What was done
  - At session close, Alan said "add VIE to PROJECTS.md as a queued project" with the directive "Don't lose the idea"
  - Searched both repos (alan-os + lux-os) for prior mentions of "VIE" — zero hits. No description, scope, owner, pipeline, or context exists on disk
  - Added stub row to `PROJECTS.md` Session Queue table flagging the gap, so the name persists for the next session and a grep for "VIE" surfaces the capture
- Blockers
  - Description is missing. Cannot infer what VIE stands for or what the project is without Alan filling it in
- Next step
  - Alan: define VIE next session — what it stands for, goal, owner, pipeline (`veritas_bd` / `loretta_re` / `mmm_trucking` / family / personal), TIER, dependencies. Then move from stub row to a proper TIER section

## 2026-04-29 Superpowers Plugin Install — Pre-flight + Inventory Pending
- What was done
  - Marketplace `claude-plugins-official` (anthropics/claude-plugins-official) is registered in settings.json and synced at `C:\Users\aserc\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\claude-plugins-official\` (lastUpdated 2026-04-29T17:12:25Z). Marketplace manifest `marketplace.json` at line 1868 lists `superpowers` as a `url`-source plugin pointing to `https://github.com/obra/superpowers.git`
  - Pre-install backups (CLAUDE.md, settings.json) confirmed at `C:\Veritas\archive\backups\2026-04-29\` per Alan's directive
- Blockers
  - Cannot run `/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official` from agent side — `/plugin` is a Claude Code built-in slash command, user-invoked only. Alan must paste it. Once it lands, plugin files appear under `~/.claude/plugins/` (likely `external_plugins/superpowers/` since the marketplace entry is `source.source: "url"` not the local `plugins/` tree)
- Next step
  - Alan pastes `/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official`
  - I inventory `skills/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `scripts/` under the installed plugin dir, diff plugin's `CLAUDE.md` against `C:\Veritas\repos\alan-os\CLAUDE.md` (specifically MEMORY BANK PROTOCOL on lines 88-91, technical rules §2, session protocol §4, 100K token discipline §6), and report any conflict before suggesting any change

## 2026-04-29 Superpowers Installed + Inventoried + CLAUDE.md §4 Patched
- What was done
  - Alan ran `/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official` then `/reload-plugins` — install reported `1 plugin · 3 skills · 6 agents · 1 hook · 0 plugin MCP servers · 0 plugin LSP servers`. `enabledPlugins: {"superpowers@claude-plugins-official": true}` written to `~/.claude/settings.json` automatically
  - Plugin landed at `C:\Users\aserc\.claude\plugins\cache\claude-plugins-official\superpowers\5.0.7\` — note this is the **cache** subdir, not `external_plugins/` as the pre-flight entry guessed. Worth knowing for future plugin debug: Anthropic-marketplace plugins cache by `<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/`
  - Inventory:
    - **14 skills** (skills/): using-superpowers, brainstorming, writing-plans, executing-plans, subagent-driven-development, dispatching-parallel-agents, test-driven-development, systematic-debugging, verification-before-completion, requesting-code-review, receiving-code-review, finishing-a-development-branch, using-git-worktrees, writing-skills
    - **3 commands**: `/brainstorm`, `/write-plan`, `/execute-plan`
    - **1 agent file**: `code-reviewer.md` (the "6 agents" reload count includes 5 internal subagents that skills spawn)
    - **1 hook**: `SessionStart` only, fires on `startup|clear|compact`. Reads `using-superpowers/SKILL.md` (~3KB) and injects it as `additionalContext`. **No PreToolUse / PostToolUse / Stop / SessionEnd hooks** — nothing wraps real tool calls. Polyglot wrapper at `hooks/run-hook.cmd` finds Git Bash on Windows
  - CLAUDE.md diff result: plugin's own `CLAUDE.md` is a contributor guide for `obra/superpowers` PRs (94% rejection rate context) — irrelevant unless contributing back. The behaviorally-loaded file is `using-superpowers/SKILL.md`, which has aggressive "before ANY response including clarifying questions" trigger language but explicitly states (lines 18-26) that user CLAUDE.md instructions take priority over skills (priority 1 vs 2 vs 3)
  - **Patched alan-os CLAUDE.md §4 Session Protocol**: added `**Memory bank reads precede all skill invocations.**` as the first bullet, restating the precedence in the project's voice. Commit `ee3571e` on `main`
- What worked
  - Verifying actual install path on disk before assuming — the `external_plugins/` guess from the pre-flight entry was wrong. The marketplace.json's `source.source: "url"` plugins still cache locally, just under `cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/`
  - Reading the plugin's own `using-superpowers/SKILL.md` priority section confirmed no real conflict before patching — the plugin authors anticipated this exact tension
- Blockers
  - None functional. Skills with aggressive auto-trigger language (using-superpowers, brainstorming, verification-before-completion, tdd, systematic-debugging) will fire on most builds going forward. Expected to add value on spec-first work (Claude Usage card, Workflow 4.1, SalesOS dashboard) and possibly add ceremony to one-shot ops. Per-skill disable list deferred until experienced
- Next step
  - Watch for `brainstorming` skill on the next "build X" request — that's the most aggressive auto-trigger
  - If skill ceremony becomes friction on small ops, add disable list to `~/.claude/settings.json`

## 2026-04-29 SESSION CLOSE — Final Roll-up
**Today's deliverables (committed + pushed unless flagged):**
1. **n8n API key rotated** — auth restored, 3.1 (`r1pkTZ94DuuWrTtA`) confirmed active 2h cadence, Video Log Sheet tab created via service account
2. **Workflow 2.4 deployed + activated** — `tX09Uxf9LdjVLmvl`, 15 nodes, validator clean
3. **SalesOS Phase 1 LIVE** — `data/leads.json` + `data/competitors.json`, 5 endpoints in `alan_os_server.py`, all smoke-tested. Specs: `docs/workflow_4_1_spec.md`, `docs/salesOS_dashboard_spec.md`
4. **`/admin/restart` fixed** — detached-helper subprocess pattern, end-to-end verified
5. **`daily_burn_rate.py` + `/health` `claude_burn`** — Claude token aggregation v0 from `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl`, 30s cached. Live snapshot at close: 14.5M billable in window, day 3.92/7, projected ~23.5M
6. **Claude Code statusline LIVE** — `~/.claude/statusline.ps1` (PowerShell, 2-line, color-coded ctx bar) wired into `~/.claude/settings.json`
7. **Superpowers plugin installed + inventoried** — 14 skills, 3 commands, 1 agent, 1 SessionStart-only hook
8. **CLAUDE.md §4 patched** — "Memory bank reads precede all skill invocations" — commit `ee3571e`
9. **Desktop inventory + org plan** — 480GB scanned, plan ready in `2026-04-29 Desktop Inventory + Org Plan` entry above. **On hold pending backup**. AWS New Biz Photos flagged sensitive (DL.jpg + SS Card.jpg) — must be handled FIRST and SEPARATELY
10. **Task Scheduler patch FILE built** at `~/.lux/workflows/AlanOS_Server.xml.patched` (Hidden=true, battery=false, ExecTimeLimit=PT0S) — **NOT applied to live task**, blocked on elevation

**Pre-write backups kept:** `C:\Veritas\archive\backups\2026-04-29\CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`

**Next session priorities (Alan-stated, in order):**
1. **Claude Usage dashboard card** — backend `/claude/usage?range=today|week|live` endpoint extracted from existing `daily_burn_rate.py` aggregation, frontend 4-tile + sparkline card on Automation tab. Spec is in the 2026-04-29 statusline entry. Effort 3-4h
2. **SalesOS dashboard tab** — kanban view per `docs/salesOS_dashboard_spec.md`, drawer-based stage transitions. Blocked on host-VM connectivity decision
3. **Workflow 4.1** — n8n lead enrichment per `docs/workflow_4_1_spec.md`. Blocked on same host-VM connectivity decision (Step 4 POST to `/leads` needs the host reachable from the n8n VM — three resolution options listed in spec: ngrok / `/admin/write-file` / move alan-os to VM)
4. **Desktop backup + cleanup** — Alan confirms full-disk backup → I draft PowerShell `-WhatIf` move script scoped one category at a time → AWS New Biz Photos handled FIRST (encrypted relocation), then archive → assets → personal → deletions

**Open carry-forward blockers:**
- **Apply Task Scheduler patch** — needs elevated PS: `schtasks /Update /TN AlanOS_Server /XML "C:\Users\aserc\.lux\workflows\AlanOS_Server.xml.patched"`, then kill old python, `/Run`, verify Hidden=true and `MainWindowHandle=0`. Until applied, server pops a console window on login and dies after 24h
- **Admin API key creation** — biggest dashboard gap (PROJECTS.md line 233); unblocks Claude Usage panel official numbers + SalesOS-vs-plan-ceiling math
- **3.2 (`VvHYTjheeecJ441F`)** still `active=false` on the wire — UI re-toggle decision pending
- **2.4 prerequisites** for first end-to-end test: `OPUS_CLIP_API_KEY` / `BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `BUFFER_PROFILE_IDS` on n8n VM, three Google cred reauths
- **Anthropic workspace key `pzDMW...`** in `.lux\.env` revoked — separate rotation owed

## 2026-04-29 VIE 5.1 Spec — Audit + Rewrite (Python-first V1)
- What was done
  - Audited existing VIE components across alan-os/workflows, .lux/workflows, and live n8n. Found substantial prior art: `nlm_feed_builder.py` v1.4 (~800 lines, ~80% of V1 already done — multi-folder MSN reads, three Claude scoring prompts, Safelink unwrap, dedup, 5 NotebookLM sinks); `extract_ai_links.py` (14-category URL classifier + tracker skip-pattern); `ai_research_monitor.py` + `ai_research_backfill.py` (older single-Doc pair, superseded by nlm_feed_builder); n8n `AlanSercy MSN Flow` (`7GEpqCGS2cP0J8wY`, active — schedule trigger + Outlook reader + Anthropic classifier + 6-folder routing + digest webhook push)
  - Flagged: AlanSercy MSN Flow uses `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.anthropic` — violates CLAUDE.md §2 ("Never use the built-in Anthropic node"). Not fixed this session — only matters if a future session forks the workflow
  - Reported audit, Alan picked **Option A — Python-first V1** with explicit constraints: extend `nlm_feed_builder.py`, capital-D `.lux\Data\ai_stack_feed.json`, `/ai_stack` endpoints in `alan_os_server.py`, dashboard panel, n8n deferred to V2
  - Discovered a parallel-session spec already at `docs/workflow_5_1_spec.md` (commit `1747450`) anchored on the wrong engine (`ai_research_monitor.py`) with lowercase `data/` and per-email schema. Read it, then **rewrote** to anchor on `nlm_feed_builder.py`, capital-D `Data\`, per-URL schema (commit `af7b40d`, +204/−133)
  - Mid-session Alan reported **a parallel Claude Code session is already building Steps 1–2** (endpoints + JSON skeleton + smoke test in progress). Stopped to avoid write conflicts; this session closed without touching `alan_os_server.py` or `ai_stack_feed.json`
- What worked
  - Live n8n REST via `.lux\.env` key worked when MCP child + User-scope env + `alan-os/.env` all returned 401. `.lux\.env` is the authoritative key location for this host
  - Reading the existing parallel-session spec before overwriting — caught the engine and path mismatches that would have shipped if I'd just rewritten without reading
- Blockers
  - None for VIE V1. Branch is 1 commit ahead of `origin/main` (`af7b40d`), not pushed
  - n8n MCP child still has stale env (same as 04-29 sessions) — needs Claude Code restart to refresh
- Next step
  - After parallel session lands Steps 1–2 in lux-os: end-to-end smoke test by running `nlm_feed_builder.py` against a known AI-research email; confirm one item per URL appears in `ai_stack_feed.json` via `GET /ai_stack`
  - Then Step 3 (extract URLs + per-URL Claude enrichment + POST sink in `nlm_feed_builder.py`) and Step 4 (dashboard tab)

## 2026-04-29 Claude Usage Dashboard Card — Built + Live
- What was done
  - Confirmed the data gap before writing code: `/health.claude_burn` carries 7-day token aggregation only — no 5h burn (that lives in the PowerShell statusline's per-message stdin, never reaches the server), no cost, no plan-ceiling reset. Reported three options to Alan; Alan picked **B — 7d card + estimated cost** (hardcode pricing table, flag as estimated).
  - Extended `~/.lux/workflows/daily_burn_rate.py` with `_PRICING_USD_PER_MTOK` per-model-family rate dict (Opus 4.x / Sonnet 4.x / Haiku 4.x / 3.5 fallbacks / 3 Opus). Per-record cost computed by reading `message.model` from each JSONL entry. Aggregated into `today_cost`, `window_cost_so_far`, `avg_daily_cost`, `projected_window_cost`, plus per-day `cost` in `by_day[]`. Added `pricing_estimated: True` + `pricing_note` so the UI can flag honestly.
  - Replaced `ClaudeUsageModule` placeholder in `~/.lux/Dashboard/index.html` with a real card that fetches `/health` (30s poll mirrors existing health refresh): 4 stat tiles (today's pace % vs 7d avg with green/amber/red coloring at <100/100-150/>150 thresholds, tokens used, cost est, window resets in Xd Yh) + 5-day vertical-bar sparkline + top-project + last-computed timestamp. New `.cu-*` CSS section reuses existing `--surface` / `--accent` / `--green/amber/red` theme tokens — works in both dark and light. "est. cost" pill on the module title carries the `pricing_note` as a tooltip.
  - `/admin/restart` to reload `daily_burn_rate.py`. Live `/health` smoke confirmed all new fields after restart: today_cost=$306.73, window_cost=$934.10, avg_daily_cost=$186.82, projected_window_cost=$1496.70, pricing_estimated=true.
  - Commit `53b60f3` on `~/.lux` main: "feat: Claude usage dashboard card" — only `workflows/daily_burn_rate.py` + `Dashboard/index.html` staged (273 +/2 −). `workflows/alan_os_server.py` had pre-existing uncommitted VIE/ai_stack endpoint work from the parallel session — left untouched/unstaged.
- What worked
  - Reporting current state vs the asked-for state before writing any code — caught that "5h and 7d burn rates" is statusline-stdin-only data, not server data, before building the wrong thing. Saved a 2-3hr branch (Option C).
  - Selective `git add <paths>` instead of `-A` — kept the parallel session's in-flight VIE endpoint work out of this commit cleanly.
  - Reusing `daily_burn_rate.py` as the single source — the dashboard card got cost data with zero new endpoints, mirroring how the `/health` `claude_burn` block was wired in the prior session.
- Blockers / caveats
  - **5h burn rate not exposed to the server.** Per-message rate-limit %s only flow through Claude Code's statusline stdin schema → `~/.claude/statusline.ps1`. To surface 5h on the dashboard, the statusline would need to POST `rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}.used_percentage` to a new server endpoint per fire (debounced 300ms). Deferred per Alan's "Option B" choice.
  - **Cost is estimated, not authoritative.** Pricing rates are base-context published numbers; the user's session is `claude-opus-4-7[1m]` (1M context) which may have a premium rate not captured here. Flagged in UI via the "est. cost" pill + tooltip carrying `pricing_note`. Authoritative numbers still need an Anthropic admin-scope API key (PROJECTS.md line 233 — separate ongoing blocker).
  - **Frontend-test gap:** verified HTTP 200 on `/dashboard`, verified the new component code is present in served HTML, verified `/health` returns every field the JSX references, but did not actually open a browser to render the React tree. If Babel-standalone trips on the JSX, only Alan loading `localhost:8000/dashboard` will catch it.
- Next step
  - Alan: load `localhost:8000/dashboard` → "Claude Usage" tab → confirm card renders without console errors. If anything breaks in the JSX, ping me with the console output.
  - Optional follow-up (not committed): if 5h matters, build a tiny `POST /claude/statusline` endpoint + edit `~/.claude/statusline.ps1` to also fire it. Adds the missing tile.
  - Optional follow-up: when admin API key lands, swap `daily_burn_rate.py`'s estimated-cost path for authoritative numbers from the Anthropic admin endpoint and reconcile drift.

## 2026-04-29 VIE 5.1 Steps 1-2 Landed — Endpoints + Smoke + Doc ID Fix
- What was done
  - **Doc ID fix in lux-os:** `ai_research_monitor.py` and `ai_research_backfill.py` were writing to non-canonical `1f3RGBRl...`. Switched both to canonical `1WD2Sr2H...` (Veritas AI Research Feed, registered in `drive_registry`/`ASSET_URLS`/`nlm_feed_builder.py`). lux-os commit `eb97800`, pushed
  - **Initial spec draft `1747450`** in alan-os anchored on the wrong engine (`ai_research_monitor.py`) — superseded mid-session by parallel session's `af7b40d` rewrite. Subsequently re-implemented endpoints to match the revised per-URL schema before any commit (caught via mid-edit system reminder)
  - **`/ai_stack` endpoints landed** in `~/.lux/workflows/alan_os_server.py` per `af7b40d` spec: `GET /ai_stack` (filters status/fit_pipeline/category/min_score, sort relevance_score desc then created_at desc), `GET /ai_stack/digest` (top-N status=new, registered before `/{id}` for route precedence), `POST /ai_stack` (per-URL record, dedup on `url`, returns `{dedup:true, id}` for repeats), `PATCH /ai_stack/{id}` (status + tags). Pydantic models `StackSource` / `NewStackItem` / `StackPatch`. Enums `AI_STACK_PIPELINES` (7), `AI_STACK_STATUSES` (4), `AI_STACK_CATEGORIES_ENUM` (11). `relevance_score` validated 0–10. lux-os commit `952862e`, pushed
  - **`ai_stack_feed.json` skeleton** at `~/.lux/Data/ai_stack_feed.json` (capital D per spec). Confirmed `data/` is gitignored on lux-os — runtime state only, not tracked
  - **Smoke test passed:** POST → 200 dedup=false; GET → count=1; POST same URL → 200 dedup=true with existing id (no duplicate row); PATCH status=reviewed → 200, updated_at bumped, tags merged; GET /ai_stack/digest → count=0 (correct, item is now `reviewed`); POST with bad `fit_pipeline` → 400 with sorted-enum hint; POST with `relevance_score=42` → 400 "must be 0-10"
  - **`/admin/restart` cold-cycle takes ~63s** — Task Scheduler `/Run` is slower than expected from a freshly-killed PID. The detached-helper restart pattern works; just budget for it. 15s poll loop wasn't enough; ended up needing ~30 polls × 0.5s + a 5s settle
- What worked
  - Reading the parallel session's revised spec end-to-end the moment the system flagged it modified, BEFORE the smoke test fired. Caught the per-email → per-URL schema flip, the score range (0-100 → 0-10), the enum rename (fit_tags array → fit_pipeline single string), the dedup key (email_id → url), and the directory casing (`data/` → `Data/`). Re-implementing endpoints first meant the smoke test verified the right contract on the first try
  - Bundling 4 smoke calls + dedup retry + 2 validation 400s into a single PowerShell block with `$ErrorActionPreference='Stop'` + per-bad-call try/catch — clean round-trip in one shot, no chatty back-and-forth
  - Selective `git add <path>` on lux-os (only `workflows/alan_os_server.py`) — kept the commit focused even though `data/ai_stack_feed.json` was modified during smoke (would have been gitignored anyway, but the discipline matters)
- Blockers
  - **n8n auth still 401 across all three key sources:** User-scope env (267-char JWT ending `ybaE`), `~/.lux/.env`, and `~/Veritas/repos/alan-os/.env`. The 04-29 rotation worked end-of-day per prior log entries but is rejected today. Not on the critical path for VIE V1 (V1 is Python-only); becomes blocking when n8n V2 work begins
  - **AlanOS_Server task still needs elevated reregister** — patched XML at `~/.lux/workflows/AlanOS_Server.xml.patched` is verified; non-elevated `schtasks /Create /F` returned "Access is denied" earlier this session. Same blocker as 04-29 entry above; carry-forward unchanged
- Next step
  - **Step 2 of `docs/workflow_5_1_spec.md` build sequence:** augment `~/.lux/workflows/nlm_feed_builder.py` with `extract_ai_stack_urls()` (port from `extract_ai_links.py:21-46`, reuse `unwrap_safelink()` from nlm_feed_builder:104-113), `AI_STACK_URL_ENRICH_PROMPT` constant, per-URL Claude call after existing `score_email()`, POST sink to `http://localhost:8000/ai_stack`. Treat POST failures as non-fatal warnings (existing `nlm_processed_ids.json` registry handles overall email dedup)
  - **Then Step 3:** end-to-end smoke against a known AI-research email — confirm one item per URL appears in `ai_stack_feed.json` via `GET /ai_stack`. Run twice to verify URL-level dedup
  - **Then Step 4:** dashboard "AI Stack" tab — default view `GET /ai_stack/digest`, full view paginated table with filter chips, action buttons round-trip status via PATCH

## 2026-04-29 Lux Command Center — Estimated Usage Panel + Burn-Rate Persistence
- What was done
  - Caught a misroute mid-task: Alan flagged that `localhost:8000` is the OLD Lux dashboard (the one I'd just shipped a card to in commit `53b60f3`) and the active dashboard is "Veritas-branded" elsewhere. Searched `C:\Veritas\repos\alan-os` (no FastAPI, no HTML, no listening port — only docs/orchestrators) and `netstat` for listening sockets. Found port `127.0.0.1:8081` PID 33688 = `python C:\Users\aserc\.lux\claude_usage_dashboard.py`, separate `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` server, serves a navy/gold "Lux Command Center · Alan OS" HTML at `~/.lux/claude_usage_dashboard.html` (1097 lines). Currently empty — `admin_key_set: false` (matches PROJECTS.md line 233 admin-key blocker). Reported the architecture mismatch and three options.
  - Alan picked **Option A** (wire local-burn data as a side-panel, leaving the existing admin-API panels intact) plus a new requirement: **persist cumulative snapshots to disk** so the dashboard shows trend over time, not just a single live read. Confirm what exists first.
  - Confirmed nothing exists: `ls ~/.lux/Data/` shows 16 JSON files, none `*burn*`/`*usage_history*`. Only `alan_os_server.py:18` imports `daily_burn_rate`. The function has no persistence layer.
  - Built persistence into `~/.lux/workflows/daily_burn_rate.py`: `_record_snapshot()` writes a 15-key lean record (~500 bytes) per get_burn_rate() cache miss to `~/.lux/Data/claude_burn_history.json` (`Data/` is gitignored — runtime state). Throttle: 5-minute minimum interval between persisted snapshots, gated by reading the last record's `captured_at`. Retention: 30 rolling days, pruned on every write. Atomic write via `.json.tmp` + `os.replace`. All persistence-path exceptions swallowed inside try/except so `/health` never breaks. `get_history(limit=500)` reader exposed for callers. `get_burn_rate()` now also stuffs the recent slice into the returned payload as `data["history"]` so consumers don't need a second call.
  - Discovered the Lux Command Center's JS already cross-fetches `localhost:8000` for everything except `/data` (admin-API) — `const API = 'http://localhost:8000'` on line 546. So no change needed to `claude_usage_dashboard.py`; the new panel just calls `API + '/health'` for the new `claude_burn.history` payload. Single source of truth on the FastAPI side.
  - Added panel to `claude_usage_dashboard.html` matching Veritas brand kit (navy `#0B1E3D` / gold `#C6A96A`, DM Sans / DM Mono, existing `.panel` / `.stat-grid` / `.stat-card` patterns). New `.est-pill` (small gold tag in the panel title), new `.bl-spark` + `.bl-axis` + `.bl-foot` styles. Panel content: 4 stat tiles (today's pace vs 7d avg with color states green/amber/red at <100/100-150/>150 thresholds, window tokens, estimated cost, window reset countdown), plus snapshot-trend sparkline (up to 48 most recent snapshots, ~4h at the 5-min cadence) with hover tooltips and start/end timestamps under the bars. New `loadLocalBurn()` JS wired into the existing `Promise.allSettled` in `refreshAll()` (60s cadence, manual refresh button works). Failure mode: tiles fall back to "—", `bl-meta` shows the failure reason.
  - Headless-Chrome `--dump-dom` end-to-end verification: panel HTML present in served page, JS ran successfully, `bl-pace="201%"` (with `class="stat-value bad"` red applied since pace > 150%), `bl-window="18.04M"`, `bl-cost="$997.24"`, `bl-reset="3d"`, sparkline rendering 1 bar (the persisted snapshot) with `today` class, footer showing "1 snapshots · 5-min cadence · 30d retention".
  - Commit `3941978` on `~/.lux` main: "feat: estimated local usage panel for Lux Command Center" — 2 files, 245 insertions.
- What worked
  - Reading the Lux Command Center HTML/JS BEFORE designing the panel — caught that it already cross-fetches `localhost:8000`, which collapsed Option A's plan from "add /local_burn endpoint to dashboard server + add panel + wire it" down to "add panel + wire it." No Python edit needed on `claude_usage_dashboard.py`. Saves complexity for free.
  - Reusing the existing 30s `_cache` TTL from `daily_burn_rate.py` as the natural snapshot trigger, then layering a SECOND throttle (5-min `_PERSIST_MIN_INTERVAL_S`) on the persistence write only. Keeps the function safe to call any number of times per minute (which `/health` polling does) while keeping the disk file growing at a sane rate.
  - Headless-Chrome `--dump-dom` with a Windows-friendly tempfile path (the bash `/tmp/...` confused Python on Windows the first try — `cygpath -w` converts cleanly). DOM-after-JS verification is the only honest UI test from a CLI, so worth the setup cost.
  - Atomic write pattern (`.tmp` + `os.replace`) — important since the file is read by the dashboard JS via `/health`, and a partial write during JSON serialization would surface as a parse error in the browser. `os.replace` is atomic on POSIX and on NTFS for same-volume renames.
- Blockers / caveats
  - **The earlier commit `53b60f3` is now orphan code** — that card sits in `~/.lux/Dashboard/index.html` (port 8000 React dashboard) which Alan does not use. Not reverted (doesn't break anything; the work might still be useful as fallback if the FastAPI dashboard ever comes back into rotation), but it's dead UI right now. Alan's call whether to revert.
  - **First snapshot is written when `get_burn_rate()` is first called after module import.** If the FastAPI server has been up a long time without `/health` traffic, the first call will only have one historical point. The trend sparkline becomes informative ~30-60 minutes in, useful ~few hours in, and starts showing real shape after a day. The empty-state copy ("Persisting first snapshot…") covers the cold-start case.
  - **Estimated cost still uses base-context published rates per model family** (Opus 4.x = $15/$75/$18.75/$1.50 per MTok input/output/cache_create/cache_read). The actual session is `claude-opus-4-7[1m]` (1M context) which may have a premium rate not captured. Surfaced via the `est` pill on the panel title with full tooltip explaining the limitation.
- Next step
  - Watch the trend over a few hours / days — confirm the sparkline shape is informative and the 5-min cadence isn't too sparse or too noisy. Tune `_PERSIST_MIN_INTERVAL_S` if needed (one-line change, no schema impact since `captured_at` is per-record).
  - Optional cleanup: revert `53b60f3` if the orphan port-8000 card bothers anyone (low priority — it's invisible unless Alan opens that dashboard).
  - When the Anthropic admin key lands, the existing admin-API panel populates and the Estimated Local Usage panel becomes a useful drift-check (local estimate vs authoritative org-wide). The panel doesn't need to change to support that.

## 2026-04-30 Closeout Sync OAuth + MMM 3.2 Verified + n8n Key Rotation
- What was done
  - **Closeout sync OAuth wired up.** Appended `VERITAS_SESSION_LOG_DOC_ID=1oGKgcM6vlHS6i6kFUPx1LVBn3PW9ghUk02nR0Dcqm38` to `~/.lux/.env` (Doc owned by `achoppers@gmail.com`, GCP project `422640626939` per OAuth client_id prefix — Alan's earlier `...979` was a typo; the JSON's project number is canonical). Confirmed `gdocs_host_client.json` saved to `~/.lux/credentials/` (Desktop OAuth client, scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` only). pip packages already installed (`google-auth 2.49.2`). Ran `python scripts/post_closeout_to_drive.py` → browser OAuth flow completed → `gdocs_host_token.json` cached (730 bytes, refresh token persisted) → 04-29 `CLOSEOUT.md` content appended to the Veritas Session Log Doc on first try. Future runs will not need a browser.
  - **MMM Workflow 3.2 verified clean.** Manual web-UI Execute (Alan-driven) on `VvHYTjheeecJ441F` completed as exec `16437` at `2026-04-30T15:16:34Z` → 35.4s, 8/8 nodes succeeded, audit email sent (Gmail msg `19ddef71e17f52b6`), 117 sent emails analyzed via Claude HTTP node (14.6s), 26 prospects pulled from MMM tracker Sheet, `Match and Compare` returned `alreadyInTracker: []` + `newProspects:` populated (Nature's Path, Chelan Fresh, plus more) + `totalProspects: 26`. Alan flagged the empty `alreadyInTracker` for manual eyeball of the audit email — could be healthy (genuinely all new) or subtle key-mismatch in the Code node.
  - **n8n API key rotated permanently.** Old JWT (jti `626ab36b`, iat `1777476006`) was 401-rejected today across MCP and direct REST. Alan rotated via n8n web UI → Settings → API. New JWT (jti `03ec48c8`, iat `1777562714`, ~24h newer) overwrote `N8N_API_KEY=` line 3 in `~/.lux/.env`. Direct curl GET on `/api/v1/workflows/VvHYTjheeecJ441F` → HTTP 200 in 132ms confirmed. Live workflow read confirms `active=False`, 8 nodes, versionId `8b2f032c-6c87-4a90-b7dc-13976060d437`, last patched `2026-04-28T23:14:25Z`.
  - **PROJECTS.md TIER 1 row updated** — Workflow 3.2 status flipped 🔜 Ready to fire → ✅ Verified clean. Active-toggle question retired with explanatory note (workflow has only Manual Trigger; `active` flag is moot in n8n for trigger-less workflows). alan-os commit `46d059a`.
- What worked
  - Closeout-sync script's `flow.run_local_server(port=0)` Desktop OAuth pattern is clean — single browser pop, no manual code paste, token persists. The `from_authorized_user_file` reload path means future session-close runs are silent.
  - **Reading the n8n workflow nodes list before recommending the active-toggle.** Caught that `VvHYTjheeecJ441F` has only a Manual Trigger node — no Schedule, Webhook, or Email Trigger. Means the `active=true` toggle the queue had been asking about for two sessions has zero functional effect. Saved a meaningless deploy step.
  - **Direct curl + REST API as the n8n auth fallback when the MCP child is stuck on a stale env.** MCP child reads `N8N_API_KEY` at startup; an `.env` edit doesn't refresh it. Direct curl + the new JWT works for the rest of this session without restart.
- Blockers / caveats
  - **MCP child still on old key for the rest of this session.** Any `mcp__n8n-mcp__n8n_*` call here will continue to 401 until Claude Code is restarted. Carry-forward unchanged from 04-29 entry. Not a problem for the next session — fresh start picks up new env.
  - **`alreadyInTracker: []` in 3.2 audit output** — could be valid (all 117 sent emails are to genuinely new contacts) or a subtle Code-node bug in `Match and Compare`. Alan to eyeball the audit email manually; no investigation budget allocated this session.
  - **AlanOS_Server task elevated reregister** still pending from 04-29 carry-forward (unrelated to this session).
- Next step
  - Closeout protocol now has a working tail: `post_closeout_to_drive.py` syncs CLOSEOUT.md to the Veritas Session Log Doc on every close. SESSION_PROTOCOL.md already references it (commit `01f2eea`). Session-close from now on = update CLOSEOUT.md → run script → done.
  - When Alan opens 3.2 audit email manually, if any `newProspects` entry is one he knows is already in the Sheet, file as a `Match and Compare` Code-node bug for next MMM session.
  - Restart Claude Code at any future session start to refresh the n8n MCP child env (transparent — happens automatically on launch).

## 2026-04-29 SalesOS Dashboard Tab — V1 Shipped (table view)
- What was done
  - Pre-build reality check before writing any UI: confirmed `localhost:8081` Lux Command Center = `~/.lux/claude_usage_dashboard.html` (served by `~/.lux/claude_usage_dashboard.py`), separate from `localhost:8000` Alan OS (`~/.lux/workflows/alan_os_server.py`). Confirmed `alan_os_server.py:55` ships `CORSMiddleware allow_origins=["*"]`, so 8081→8000 fetches work direct (verified via `curl -I -H "Origin: localhost:8081"` returning `access-control-allow-origin: *`). Confirmed lead schema (`alan_os_server.py:466`): owner / pipeline / company / source / contact_name / contact_title / contact_email / contact_linkedin / **stage** (7 values: prospect→researched→contacted→responded→qualified→closed→dead) / last_contact / next_action / next_action_date / notes. **No `score` field on leads.**
  - Reported 3 schema mismatches in the original ask (status→stage, last_activity→last_contact, score=missing) with proposed mapping. Alan approved with "go".
  - Updated `docs/salesOS_dashboard_spec.md` (alan-os) — replaced the older 7-column kanban spec with a sortable-table V1 that explains the deviation and what's deferred to V2 (kanban, drag/drop, side-drawer PATCH, New Lead modal, score column once Workflow 4.1 lands).
  - Built the SalesOS tab in `claude_usage_dashboard.html`: nav button after `vault`, new `<section id="tab-salesos">` with three panels (Filters / Leads / Competitor intel), ~110 lines of CSS reusing `--navy`/`--gold`/`--surface`/`--border` tokens (no new palette), ~250 lines of JS — `loadSalesOS()`, `renderLeadsTable()` (clickable column-header sort, defaults `last_contact desc`), `renderCompetitors()`, `fmtRelative()` for "3d ago"-style timestamps, `STAGE_BADGE` map mapping stages to existing `.badge.{idle,amber,gold,green,red}` classes, `staleBadge()` that flags competitors > 90d. Wired `loadSalesOS()` into the existing `Promise.allSettled` in `refreshAll()`. Filter `<select>`s rebuild query string and refetch on every change.
  - **Smoke test:** POST 4 test leads via curl + heredoc files (regular curl quoting got mangled by Windows bash — heredoc `--data-binary @file.json` works clean): Acme PE Holdings (alan/veritas_bd/contacted), Sunset Realty Group (loretta/loretta_re/qualified), Highway Logistics (mmm/mmm_trucking/prospect), Old Closed Co (alan/veritas_bd/closed). Verified `/leads` filter shapes return correctly: all=4, pipeline=veritas_bd→2, stage=qualified→1. Seeded 2 competitor records directly to `~/.lux/Data/competitors.json` (Bain Capital Operators, REtipster) since `POST /competitors` doesn't exist (read-only endpoint). `Data/` is gitignored so seeds stay out of the lux-os commit.
  - Verified served HTML (`curl localhost:8081/dashboard`): all 17 SalesOS markers present, 7 nav buttons paired to 7 tab sections (automation/projects/tasks/n8n/digest/vault/salesos), file size grew from 36KB to 67KB.
- What worked
  - Reading the existing spec at `docs/salesOS_dashboard_spec.md` BEFORE rewriting — surfaced that the original 7-column kanban scope was already on disk and let me document the deviation honestly rather than silently shipping a different shape
  - Probing both candidate dashboards (`8000` vs `8081`) before assuming which one the user meant — the user said "Lux Command Center at 8081" but `claude_usage_dashboard.html` also lives at `~/.lux/` root, and there's a `Dashboard/index.html` parallel. Confirming the live server's PID and source file ruled out the wrong one fast
  - Heredoc + `--data-binary @file.json` for POST /leads — the standard `curl -d '{...}'` form gets shell-mangled on Windows bash even with single quotes, returns 422. Heredoc-into-tempfile pattern is the durable fix for any non-trivial JSON POST from this shell
- Blockers / caveats
  - Test data left in place (`leads.json` has 4 records, `competitors.json` has 2) for visual verification when Alan opens `localhost:8081`. Cleanup pattern from prior session was POST→smoke→DELETE; re-applied here would mean Alan loads the dashboard to a globally empty state. If Alan wants the test data wiped, next session: reset `~/.lux/Data/leads.json` and `competitors.json` to their empty wrappers
  - Headless-Chrome DOM-after-JS verification was NOT run this session (the earlier session used it for the burn-rate panel). The new SalesOS code passes static structural checks — markers present, sections paired, file size sane — but only Alan loading `localhost:8081` will catch any JS edge cases
  - Score column omitted (no field on leads). Workflow 4.1 spec adds `relevance_score` during enrichment — when 4.1 ships, add a `Score` column to `renderLeadsTable()` and a `min_score` filter, ~10 lines of additions
- Next step
  - Alan: open `localhost:8081`, click SalesOS tab, verify table renders with 4 leads. Change Pipeline filter to `veritas_bd` → expect 2 leads + Bain Capital card visible in competitor section. Filter Stage to `qualified` → expect Sunset Realty only
  - If anything broken, ping with browser console errors
  - V2 work (when Alan asks): kanban view, side-drawer PATCH for stage transitions, New Lead modal, competitor edit UI, score column once 4.1 lands

## 2026-04-30 VIE Step 4 — AI Stack Dashboard Tab Shipped
- What was done
  - Confirmed live state before writing UI: `GET /ai_stack` and `GET /ai_stack/digest` both return the seed item (`dda67429-...`, score 7, status `new`) — endpoints from VIE Steps 1–2 (`952862e`) work as documented. Read backend enums from `~/.lux/workflows/alan_os_server.py:625-630` for the chip values: 7 pipelines (`ai_stack`, `veritas`, `agentos`, `personalos`, `loretta`, `mmm`, `none`), 4 statuses (`new`, `reviewed`, `saved`, `dismissed`), 11 categories (`YouTube`, `Anthropic`, `OpenAI`, `GitHub`, `n8n / Automation`, `AI Research`, `HBR / Strategy`, `Newsletter`, `LinkedIn`, `Real Estate`, `Other`).
  - Modeled the new tab on the SalesOS tab (shipped 2026-04-29 in same file) — same nav-button pattern, same `Promise.allSettled` registration, same Veritas brand tokens (`--navy` `#0B1E3D` / `--gold` `#C6A96A`), same `.badge` color classes. Added one CSS section, one `<section id="tab-ai-stack">`, one JS module (`AISTACK_STATE`, `loadAIStack`, `renderAIStackList`, `patchAIStackItem`, `renderAIStackPager`, `renderAIChips`, `setAIStackMode`, `clearAIStackFilters`, `buildAIStackQuery`).
  - **UX contract:** Two modes via segmented control. Top picks (default) calls `GET /ai_stack/digest?limit=10` and shows score + title + summary + fit_rationale + meta + Save/Reviewed/Dismiss. All items calls `GET /ai_stack` with chip filters → client-side paginates at 20/page. Chips for status / fit_pipeline / category each include an `all` chip that clears that filter. Buttons disable when status already matches (e.g., a `saved` item shows Save disabled). PATCH on click → refetch on success → revert state on failure with alert. Click any title or url to open in new tab.
  - **Files touched:** `~/.lux/claude_usage_dashboard.html` only (1641 → 2086 lines, +445). Backend untouched — the four endpoints from VIE Steps 1–2 cover everything needed.
  - **Static-on-disk verification (8081 was not running):** grepped 26 new markers across all expected ids/symbols (`tab-ai-stack`, `count-ai-stack`, `ais-chips-{status,pipeline,category}`, `loadAIStack`, `AIS_*_VALUES`, `patchAIStackItem`, `renderAIStackPager`, `setAIStackMode`). PATCH round-trip against live `:8000` confirmed the JS body shape works: `PATCH /ai_stack/{id}` body `{"status":"saved"}` → `200 {"ok":true,"item":...}`; reverted to `{"status":"new"}` → same shape. Feed left in starting state.
  - lux-os commit `33f5e86` on main: "feat: AI Stack tab on Lux Command Center" — single file, +445 insertions.
- What worked
  - Reading the SalesOS tab end-to-end before writing AI Stack code — caught the `STAGE_BADGE` map pattern, the `Promise.allSettled` registration site, and the `panel-meta` text-update pattern. The new tab is structurally identical to SalesOS so future edits to one inform the other.
  - Backend-enum probe before writing chips — pulled exact category/pipeline/status sets from the live server constants (`AI_STACK_CATEGORIES_ENUM`, `AI_STACK_PIPELINES`, `AI_STACK_STATUSES`) instead of inferring from the spec doc, which avoided drift if the spec and code disagree.
  - PATCH round-trip with both directions (`saved` → `new`) before commit — verified the round-trip and left the feed in its starting state in one shot. Standard pattern from prior sessions.
- Blockers / caveats
  - **Lux Command Center server (`:8081`) was not running this session** — `claude_usage_dashboard.py` is an Alan-controlled process, not auto-started. Per CLAUDE.md "Ask before any action that touches credentials or `~/.lux/`" I did not start it. Static disk + backend round-trip is the strongest verification I can give without Alan loading the page. Edge cases that only show under live JS render (Babel/syntax errors, layout overflow on small viewports, action-button focus rings) won't surface until Alan loads `localhost:8081`.
  - **Only one item in the feed** (the VIE Step 2 smoke seed). Pagination, multi-page filter, and "no items match these filters" empty state are coded but exercised only by mock-data inspection, not by real volume. First real load will be once `nlm_feed_builder.py` Step 2 lands and an AI-research email gets enriched.
  - **Backend uses `fit_pipeline` enum `{ai_stack, veritas, agentos, personalos, loretta, mmm, none}`** — this differs from the SalesOS lead pipeline enum `{veritas_bd, loretta_re, mmm_trucking, ...}` (which is a separate field on a separate object). The chip values match the AI Stack backend exactly — confirmed against `alan_os_server.py:625-626` — but anyone hand-comparing the two tabs may find the mismatch surprising.
  - **Top picks (digest) row hides the pager.** Filters do nothing in digest mode (the digest endpoint takes only `limit`). If a future user expects "filter the top picks" the wiring needs to either pass filters into `/ai_stack/digest` (server change) or run a filtered `/ai_stack` and slice top-N client-side. Not flagged as blocking — current behavior matches the spec.
- Next step
  - Alan: start the Lux Command Center if not running (`python ~/.lux/claude_usage_dashboard.py`), open `localhost:8081`, click "AI Stack" tab. Verify: Top picks shows the smoke item with score 7. Click Save → row should refresh and Save is now disabled (status=`saved`). Switch to "All items" → status chip `saved` should now have a match; clearing chips returns to one row.
  - Once `nlm_feed_builder.py` Step 2 lands and real items pour in, return here to verify pagination kicks in at 20+ items and the "filtered empty state" copy reads right.
  - If anything breaks at render time, ping with browser console output — the JS structure is parallel to SalesOS so any issue likely affects an isolated function (most-likely suspects: `renderAIChips()` if a category string with ` / ` confuses the data-attribute round-trip).

## 2026-04-30 Workflow 4.1 — SalesOS Lead Enrichment Built (hybrid C, MMM tracker)
- What was done
  - Reverified divergence between user's verbal scope and committed `docs/workflow_4_1_spec.md` (V0): V0 wanted full-JSON webhook → POST `/leads` only; user wanted lead_id webhook → Sheet read + Sheet writeback. Surfaced the four-axis diff (input shape, lead source, lead sink, notify) before writing code; Alan picked **hybrid C** (read+write Sheet AND POST /leads) plus ngrok for the VM→host POST resolution
  - Read MMM Prospect Tracker schema via existing `~/.lux/workflows/probe_sheets.py` pattern (service account `lux-automation@lux-host-493415.iam.gserviceaccount.com`, `~/.lux/credentials/service_account.json`). **Sheet has 6 tabs; header row is row 3, not row 1.** Banner at rows 1-2. The `(n8n)` tab is the integration target (19 cols, no Email-1/2/3 sent dates) — separate from the human `WA Prospect Tracker` tab so writes don't trample manual edits
  - Rewrote `docs/workflow_4_1_spec.md` (+209 / −112) anchoring on hybrid C: `lead_id` keyed on `#` column (col B), pipeline=`mmm_trucking`, owner=`alan`, stage=`researched` on success; blank-only writeback for Type / What They Ship / Known Ship-To / Est. Loads (preserves Loretta's manual edits); Notes always appends `[salesos-enrich YYYY-MM-DD]` block; `[mmm:#=N]` tag prefixed in `/leads` notes for Phase 2 dedup
  - Built `workflows/workflow_4_1_lead_enrichment.json` (18 nodes, ~14 KB): Webhook + Manual → Merge → Normalize → IF Validate (false→Respond 400) → Sheets Lookup → IF Row Found (false→Respond 404) → Code Build apiBody → HTTP Anthropic (4.2, x-api-key, raw body per CLAUDE.md §2) → Code Parse → Sheets Update → HTTP POST /leads (`={{ $env.ALAN_OS_PUBLIC_URL }}/leads`) → Respond 200. All HTTP/Sheets nodes `onError: continueErrorOutput` fan into Build Error Payload → Gmail Send Error → Respond 500
  - Validation loop via `mcp__n8n-mcp__validate_workflow` at runtime profile: first pass had 6 errors (IF unary operator missing `singleValue: true`, Sheets read+update missing top-level `range`, Sheets update missing `values`, Webhook with `responseNode` mode missing `onError: continueRegularOutput`, optional chaining `?.` not supported in n8n expressions). Fixed all six. Final pass: 0 errors. Remaining warnings are non-blocking: typeVersion bumps (kept HTTP at 4.2 per CLAUDE.md §2 mandate, Sheets at 4.4 per 2.4 deploy precedent), IF main[1] false-positive (validator misreads false-branch as error output), URL expression env-var false-positive
  - Committed `9b99cf3` on alan-os main: `feat: Workflow 4.1 SalesOS lead enrichment (hybrid C, MMM tracker)` — 2 files, +769 / −112 (spec rewrite + new workflow JSON)
- What worked
  - Reading the MMM tracker schema via service account BEFORE writing any nodes — caught the row-3 header, the dual-tab pattern (`WA Prospect Tracker` human vs `WA Prospect Tracker (n8n)` machine), and that there is no native `Lead ID` column (so `#` becomes the keying column, with the documented fragility caveat for row reorders). Reusing `probe_sheets.py` pattern saved ~10 min of credential-flow setup
  - Surfacing the spec divergence as a four-axis diff table BEFORE proposing approaches — Alan's "C — hybrid" answer landed cleanly, no follow-up scope ambiguity. The "confirm before building; report commit hashes" feedback memory exactly applies here: gate at the design boundary, then build cleanly
  - `mcp__n8n-mcp__validate_node` per-node loop on the Sheets read + update operations — surfaced the top-level `range` requirement and the `values` field for update that the workflow-level validator only labels generically. Faster than guessing from the get_node search_properties results
  - Quoting the sheet name with single quotes in A1 notation (`'WA Prospect Tracker (n8n)'!A3:S`) — required because the sheet name contains spaces. Validator caught this on a second pass
- Blockers / caveats
  - **Not deployed.** n8n REST 401 carry-forward from prior sessions still blocks API import. Manual web-UI import path is documented in spec
  - **`ALAN_OS_PUBLIC_URL` env var must be set on n8n VM before first live run.** Alan owns ngrok lifecycle. Spec calls this out
  - **PLACEHOLDER_GMAIL cred ID** in error path — must be replaced with the live Gmail OAuth cred ID before import, OR wired through the UI after import
  - **Lead ID = `#` column is fragile** if Loretta inserts a row mid-table. Documented in spec; OK for V1 since the Sheet's pattern is append-only
- Next step
  - Alan: when ready to deploy, set `ALAN_OS_PUBLIC_URL` on n8n VM, expose host `:8000` via ngrok, swap the Gmail cred placeholder, import via n8n web UI, test with `lead_id=1` (Stemilt Growers)
  - Watch Sheet writeback against Loretta's edits — confirm blank-only policy holds in practice
  - Phase 2 candidates: dedup on `[mmm:#=N]` tag in `POST /leads`; add new columns (Company Summary / Fit Signal / Fit Rationale / Competitor Notes) to `(n8n)` tab and decompress from Notes blob; parameterize `sheetName` for the other 4 tabs (HP Hood, Utah-Idaho, CA Receivers)

## 2026-05-01 Digest ↔ Dashboard Reconciled to Single JSON Source of Truth
- What was done
  - **Audit first.** Traced Tasks-button stack: `claude_usage_dashboard.html:1302-1323` `[data-complete]`/`[data-reopen]` listeners → `fetch PATCH ${API}/tasks/{id}` (API=`http://localhost:8000`, CORS open) → `alan_os_server.py:390-400` updates `~/.lux/Data/tasks.json` and stamps `completed_at`. Confirmed real end-to-end (task-001 + task-002 both completed_at=2026-04-30 in tasks.json — actual button presses).
  - **Audit two.** Compared digest sources vs dashboard sources. Canonical digest is `daily_digest_v3.py` (referenced as the only entry in `alan_os_server.py:51` SCRIPTS dict; v1 + v2 were dead on disk). Found: digest was reading `Desktop/Alan AI Stack/AI Vault/command_center.md` which **does not exist** (only `inbox_dashboard.md` is in that folder), so `parse_command_center()` had been silently returning `[]` every run for an unknown duration. Dashboard reads `~/.lux/Data/{projects,tasks,knowledge,leads,ai_stack_feed,...}.json`. Zero source overlap. `/digest` endpoint backed by `digest_history.json` which was `[]` because the digest never wrote to it. Classic Principle 8 violation — two parallel "to-do" surfaces, one rotted entirely.
  - **Fixed.** Replaced `parse_command_center()` with `build_workstreams_from_json()` reading `projects.json` + `tasks.json` (same shape `{name, status, open, overdue}` so HTML render functions need no template changes). Added `record_digest_history()` that appends a per-run summary record (`id, ran_at, total_open, total_overdue, accounts.{inbox_unread,inbox_total}`) to `digest_history.json` capped at 50 records — wires `/digest`. Refreshed `WORKSTREAM_ICONS` to match real project names (USAA, ENDURANCE, PARENTS HOUSE) and dropped stale CLAIM MANAGEMENT keys. Deleted `daily_digest.py` + `daily_digest_v2.py` via `git rm`.
  - **Smoke test.** Stubbed `win32com.client` and called the new functions in isolation (no Outlook, no email sends). Result: 10 workstreams populated from JSON (AgentOS-VM correctly skipped — idle status, no open work). USAA flagged 1 overdue (task-003 deadline 2026-04-16). Endurance flagged 1 overdue (task-004 deadline 2026-04-18). Totals: 4 open, 2 overdue. `digest_history.json` gained entry `digest-20260501-151116`. `curl localhost:8000/digest` returns it cleanly.
  - lux-os commit `0d14134` on main: `fix: reconcile digest and dashboard to single JSON source of truth, wire /digest endpoint` — 3 files, +128 / −940
- What worked
  - **Auditing before touching code.** Tracing the full Tasks button stack first surfaced that the existing dashboard side already worked end-to-end (don't fix what isn't broken). Surfacing the missing `command_center.md` file via direct `ls` of the Vault folder caught the silent-empty-workstreams failure mode that no code review would have found
  - **Stubbing `win32com.client` for isolated unit testing.** Let me run `build_workstreams_from_json()` and `record_digest_history()` without firing `main()` (which would have sent unscheduled emails to Alan AND Loretta). Pattern: inject fake modules into `sys.modules` before import. Saved having to add a `--dry-run` flag to scope or accept real email side-effects on a test run
  - **Keeping the dict shape `{name, status, open, overdue}` identical to what `workstream_cards()` consumed.** Zero template changes — only the source of the dicts changed. Minimum-blast-radius surgery
- Blockers / caveats
  - **Test record left in `digest_history.json`** (id `digest-20260501-151116`) — has REAL workstream totals (4 open, 2 overdue) but MOCK inbox counts (123/5, 45/2, etc. for MSN/Gmail/Loretta/Keys/MMM). Dashboard `/digest` will display these mock numbers until the next real digest run overwrites/appends. Consider clearing if the mock numbers are confusing. Future runs will append normally and the 50-record cap rotates the test entry out
  - **Did NOT run the full `main()` end-to-end.** Doing so would have sent the morning digest to alansercy@gmail.com AND lorettasercy@gmail.com out-of-cycle (likely a second email of the day for both). Per CLAUDE.md "Ask before any action that touches credentials or `~/.lux/`" + the user-facing nature of email to Loretta, opted for isolated-function testing. The next scheduled run (or Alan triggering Task Scheduler manually) will exercise the full pipeline
  - **WORKSTREAM_ICONS substring matching** — `if k in name.upper()` means projects without a matching key fall back to `📌`. Currently 10/11 match; "Family property hit list — parents house" matches "PARENTS HOUSE" key
  - **"Family property hit list — parents house"** has no tasks in tasks.json — workstream card renders with no items but with `🟡 Active checklist — inside and outside tasks open` status. Suggests the "checklist" lives in `next_actions[]` on the project record, not as discrete tasks. Migration path if Alan wants those visible: include `next_actions[]` in the workstream open list when the project has zero tasks. Not done in this fix (out of scope)
- Next step
  - Watch the next scheduled digest run (or trigger Lux Morning Run task manually) — confirm Alan's morning email shows the JSON-sourced workstream cards and a fresh `digest_history.json` record lands. Lux dashboard `/digest` tile then reflects daily digest history
  - If the test record's mock inbox counts are distracting, reset `~/.lux/Data/digest_history.json` to `[]` — one line, harmless
  - Optional follow-up: extend `build_workstreams_from_json()` to also surface `project.next_actions[]` when no discrete tasks exist (would unblock the "parents house" case mentioned above)

## 2026-05-01 VIE YouTube Intelligence Engine — V1 shipped end-to-end (parallel session)
*This session ran in parallel with the Digest/Dashboard reconciliation above. Different scope, different files. Both committed cleanly.*

- What was done
  - **Mandatory adversarial principles review run BEFORE any code.** Spec required it as the first step. Read full codebase: `alan_os_server.py` (1200 lines), `lux_launcher.py`, `nlm_feed_builder.py` (1059 lines), `shorts_researcher.py`, `extract_ai_links.py`, `ai_research_monitor.py`, `norman_inbox_guard.py`, `orchestrator.py` / `orchestrator_v2.py`, `agents/agent_{a,b,c}.md`, `workflow_4_1_lead_enrichment.json`. Wrote `memory-bank/PRINCIPLES_REVIEW_v1.md` (~9 sections, 312 lines). Top finding: **5 of 9 principles had vague phrases or unmeasurable acceptance criteria**, 5+ memory shadow stores violated P8, `/admin/*` and `/digest/action` endpoints unauthenticated (P6 violation that becomes public RCE the moment Cloudflare Tunnel exposes localhost:8000).
  - **Spec location bug surfaced.** Spec self-declared canonical location at `repos/alan-os/memory-bank/VIE_YOUTUBE_INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE.md`; actual location is `repos/memory-bank/VIE_YOUTUBE_INTELLIGENCE_ENGINE.md` (one level higher). Logged in §8 of PRINCIPLES_REVIEW_v1.
  - **Build-or-extend correction after Alan verification challenge.** My initial review recommended "extend, do not build new" based on assumption that `shorts_researcher.py` already did transcript extraction. Alan asked me to verify against actual file contents. Re-read confirmed: `shorts_researcher.py` is **metadata-only** (regex on YouTube page HTML for title + channel; Claude infers topic from title), no yt-dlp anywhere in the codebase, `nlm_feed_builder.py`'s `/ai_stack` POST uses email-context (subject/sender/body excerpt) not video content. `ai_stack_feed.json` had 1 hand-crafted smoke-test item from Apr 29; no real run data. Corrected recommendation: yt-dlp transcript extraction + principles rubric is genuinely new code; build it, but integrate into existing `/ai_stack` (no parallel `vie_stack_log.jsonl`) and route email-driven YouTube URLs through the new module.
  - **Three .bat launchers created** at `C:\Veritas\scripts\` (Alan asked for these as a priority interrupt during the review): `launch_alan_os.bat`, `launch_loretta_os.bat`, `launch_apexbot.bat`. Each cd's into its repo + spawns PowerShell with `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`. (Side effect: enabled the parallel digest-reconcile session above.)
  - **Security patch (BEFORE Cloudflare Tunnel).** Generated `ALAN_OS_ADMIN_TOKEN` (43-char `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`), appended to `~/.lux/.env`. Patched `alan_os_server.py` to add `Depends(require_admin_token)` checking `X-Admin-Token` header on `/admin/write-file`, `/admin/restart`, `/digest/action`. Verified end-to-end: 401 without/with bad token, 200 with valid token, `/health` unchanged. Server restarted via `Stop-ScheduledTask` + `Start-ScheduledTask AlanOS_Server`. Committed `fcce3f3` on lux-os.
  - **`/ai_stack` schema extended** with optional `stack_evaluation` block (recommendation, stack_layer, replaces_or_complements, confidence, reasoning, action_items). Backward compatible — `nlm_feed_builder.py`'s email-context POSTs leave it null. Verified via curl round-trip; smoke items dismissed via PATCH (Apr 29 vie-step2-smoke + new May 1 schema-smoke both → status=dismissed). Committed `711a3be` on lux-os.
  - **`workflows/yt_transcribe.py` built** — 482 lines on alan-os. yt-dlp `--write-auto-subs --sub-format vtt --skip-download` for transcript extraction; `clean_vtt()` strips WEBVTT headers + timestamps + HTML tags + dedups repeated lines (auto-captions repeat across rolling segments); Claude Sonnet 4.6 with the revised principles rubric (PRINCIPLES_REVIEW_v1 §7) as the cached system prompt; structured JSON output parsed and POSTed to `/ai_stack`. CLI: single URL, `--batch file`, `--dry-run`, `--max-workers N`, `--out json`, `--context alan_os` (only context in V1). UTF-8 stdout reconfigure for cp1252 console safety. Committed `02df41a` on alan-os.
  - **`nlm_feed_builder.py` patched** to route YouTube URLs through `yt_transcribe.py` via subprocess. New `post_via_yt_transcribe(url)` helper. Non-YouTube URLs stay on the existing email-context path. Committed `f3f1a58` on lux-os.
  - **`memory-bank/PRINCIPLES_REVIEW_v1.md` committed** + `.gitignore` typo fix (a stray `ADD: __pycache__/` literal from a bash heredoc misfire → `__pycache__/` + `*.pyc`). Committed `8e5ddc7` on alan-os.
  - **Group 1 batch (6 URLs, parallel max-workers=4):** all 6 transcripts pulled (no caption fallbacks), all 6 evaluated, all 6 posted. **1 ADOPT / 0 EVAL / 0 MONITOR / 5 REJECT, all HIGH confidence.** ADOPT = `shorts/3E59wf8RA8Y` "Claude Code skill-building tips" (AI Honeycove) — a *pattern* (gotchas section, folder-as-skill, context+constraints), not a tool. Three concrete extend-in-place action items for CLAUDE.md / skill files. Committed `d1b46f9` on alan-os along with `STACK_DESIGN.md` seed.
  - **Groups 2-4 batches (8 URLs total, sequential max-workers=1 per Alan directive):** all 8 transcripts pulled, all 8 evaluated, all 8 posted. **0 ADOPT / 0 EVAL / 1 MONITOR / 7 REJECT.** Only MONITOR: `shorts/Wl6ns0uvXxo` "Claude Code + Notebook LM is AWESOME" — `notebookmation` CLI bridge with high-but-unquantified overlap with `nlm_feed_builder.py`; LOW confidence pending repo investigation. STACK_DESIGN.md updated with §2.B + §3 + §5 aggregate findings. Committed `3682317` on alan-os.
  - **All 14 spec URLs processed.** Aggregate: **1 ADOPT (7%) / 0 EVAL / 1 MONITOR (7%) / 12 REJECT (86%)**. P7 (build-or-extend) was the most-cited principle in REJECT reasonings (12/14). The single ADOPT was a pattern, not a tool — exactly what P7 wants.
- What worked
  - **Reading the codebase before writing the rubric.** PRINCIPLES_REVIEW_v1 §3 Violation 1 caught the proposed engine overlap with 4 existing scripts. Without that pre-read, the build would have been a P7 violation by definition.
  - **Alan verification challenge — read shorts_researcher.py in full and answer 5 specific questions before patching anything.** I had glossed over the actual capability of existing scripts in my first review. The detailed 5-question audit forced me to verify that yt-dlp + transcripts genuinely do not exist in the codebase, which corrected the architecture from "extend everything" to "build the transcript layer, integrate via existing `/ai_stack`."
  - **Atomic commits with hashes reported after each.** Standing rule from feedback memory ("Confirm before building; report commit hashes after every commit"). Seven commits across two repos, each named per-concern, easy to revert one without the others.
  - **Sequential batches (max-workers=1) for Groups 2-4.** No new principle violations; all 8 URLs processed cleanly. The reasoning quality on the lone MONITOR (Wl6ns0uvXxo / notebookmation) is the kind of "high-overlap-but-low-info" verdict the rubric is supposed to produce — neither auto-ADOPT (no benchmarks) nor auto-REJECT (real adjacency to active work).
  - **Schema extension was backward compatible.** `nlm_feed_builder.py`'s existing email-context POSTs simply have `stack_evaluation = null` and continue working. No coordinated migration needed.
- Blockers / caveats
  - **Caching anomaly — open for next session.** SDK 0.94.0 reported `cache_creation_input_tokens=0` and `cache_read_input_tokens=0` across Groups 2-4 despite `cache_control: ephemeral` set on the system prompt. Group 1 showed `cache_write=2316` correctly but `cache_read=0` (parallel race-write). Per-URL token cost in G2-G4 was lower than fully uncached, so something happened on Anthropic side, but the SDK is not surfacing it via `msg.usage`. Hypothesis: SDK attribute name mismatch on the usage object. Not blocking — functional output unaffected.
  - **`docs/veritas-company-narrative.md` had pre-existing uncommitted modifications** at session start (Workflow 4.1 status line — spec'd → built, syncing narrative to commit `9b99cf3` from 2026-04-30). I did not author this change but committed it during close-out as `d304ec5` to leave the working tree clean per Alan's directive.
  - **AlanOS_Server task** appears to NOT auto-start at host login despite HANDOFF saying it does — port 8000 was empty when I tested at session start, task was in "Ready" state (registered but not running). Started it manually with `Start-ScheduledTask`. Investigate auto-start trigger next session if Alan cares.
  - **Two smoke-test items in `ai_stack_feed.json` were dismissed (status=dismissed) via PATCH** (Apr 29 vie-step2-smoke + new May 1 schema-smoke). Real Group 1-4 items are status=new. Counts in dashboard AI Stack tab will show 14 new items + 2 dismissed.
  - **Parallel session caveat.** The Digest/Dashboard reconcile session above ran during this session's close-out and committed lux-os `0d14134` + alan-os `6d9ff5a` while I was attempting to Edit session-log.md. My Edit was rejected (file modified since read), so I re-Read and re-Edited cleanly. No conflicts — different scopes, different files.
- Next step
  - **Queued for next session, NOT building now per Alan:**
    1. `templates/BUILD_OR_EXTEND.md` — template for the P7 acceptance test (overlap math, removal-impact list, justification or extension PR plan). Cited as missing 12/14 times in this session REJECT reasonings.
    2. `closed_dependencies.md` — exception list for P1 (Buffer/Twilio/Lofty/Outlook COM/Google Workspace are accepted closed-API exceptions). Currently referenced but not authored.
    3. **Consolidate `shorts_researcher.py` + `extract_ai_links.py` + `ai_research_monitor.py`.** Per PRINCIPLES_REVIEW_v1 Violation 1: ≥60% overlap among the four URL-extraction scripts (including `nlm_feed_builder.py`). Proposed canonical: `nlm_feed_builder.py` (most complete, has VIE V1 sink). Archive the other three or fold into a single ingest module. *NOTE: the parallel session already deleted `daily_digest.py` + `daily_digest_v2.py` (different files; same versioning hygiene principle).*
  - **Caching investigation (next session):** check `msg.usage` shape with SDK 0.94.0 against latest Anthropic prompt-caching docs. Possible fix is using prompt-caching beta header or different attribute path. Verify with one synchronous + one cached call and inspect raw HTTP response.
  - **Watch list (re-eval gates) from STACK_DESIGN.md §3:**
    - `notebookmation` — locate repo, assess API vs scrape; promote to EVALUATE if documented API
    - `Claude Mem` — find repo + benchmarks; promote to EVALUATE if documented API
    - `Whisper Flow` — re-evaluate when PersonalOS dictation use case becomes active
    - Charlie Automates channel — deprioritize unless titles indicate technical depth
  - **Do NOT schedule recurring agents yet** per Alan — that decision needs his input on cadence and digest integration first.
  - **AlanOS_Server is currently running** (started this session via Start-ScheduledTask). Restart-on-login behavior unverified.
- Session close
  - `push_handoff.py` ran cleanly — 7,111 chars written to handoff_doc (`1MOvSzYF7iV0tEICRJfforTIojYigryi6MOFDpako5xQ`) on Drive.
  - Final session commits (this session's work): `fcce3f3` `711a3be` `02df41a` `f3f1a58` `8e5ddc7` `d1b46f9` `3682317` `7760f9e` `d304ec5` (9 commits across alan-os + lux-os). Plus parallel session: `0d14134` (lux-os) + `6d9ff5a` (alan-os).
  - Working tree clean across both repos at session exit.

## 2026-05-01 New Task Form on Lux Command Center + Session-Close Checklist
- What was done
  - **Form built into Tasks tab** at `~/.lux/claude_usage_dashboard.html` (port 8081, served by `claude_usage_dashboard.py`). Five fields per spec — title (text, required, maxlength 200), project (`<select>` populated from `GET /projects`, required), priority (`<select>` today / this-week / backlog), deadline (`<input type="date">`, optional), notes (text, optional). Submit POSTs JSON to `${API}/tasks` (`API = http://localhost:8000`, CORS open per `alan_os_server.py:55`). Success → clears form, resets priority to default, reloads task table via `loadTasks()`, shows green confirmation `Added task-NNN: <title>`. Failure → preserves entered values, shows inline red `Failed — <message>`. Empty deadline/notes coerced to `null` before POST so backend records consistent with existing rows
  - **Three small wires** beyond the form itself: (1) `populateTaskFormProjects(projects)` helper called from inside `loadTasks()` after the existing `/projects` fetch — single fetch serves both table render and form dropdown. (2) `submitTaskForm(e)` handler with the validate→disable→POST→re-enable sequence. (3) `PRI_ORDER` extended with `'backlog': 3` so newly-submitted backlog tasks sort sensibly in the existing table. Submit listener attached on initial script load right next to the existing `refresh-btn` listener
  - **CSS reuse** — all styles use existing CSS vars (`--surface-2`, `--border`, `--gold`, `--text`, `--muted`, `--red`, `--green`). Inputs and selects mirror the SalesOS filter pattern (DM Mono, surface-2 background, gold focus border). Submit button uses existing `.btn` class verbatim. Zero new dependencies, zero new color tokens, zero brand drift. Form panel uses the existing `.panel` / `.panel-title` shell — visually a sibling of the task list panel
  - **POST round-trip verified via curl** (cannot click a browser form from CLI — handed off visual test to Alan). Posted `task-011` "TEST: form smoke (delete me)" with priority=today, project_id=veritas-ai, deadline=2026-05-01, notes self-documenting safe-to-delete. Backend returned 200 with the new task record. tasks.json now has 11 entries. GET /tasks returns the new row. Form payload shape is byte-equivalent to what the JS will send
  - **Session-close checklist added to `CLAUDE.md` §4** per the spec: (1) mark completed tasks done in tasks.json (via dashboard Complete button or direct edit), (2) add any new tasks surfaced during the session (via the new form or direct edit), (3) update affected `projects.json` status fields (status + status_note that the digest renders), (4) confirm `push_handoff.py` fired. Closes the loop on the digest/dashboard reconciliation — both surfaces now share the JSON files AND there's an explicit protocol for keeping the JSON fresh at session close
  - lux-os commit `5bf8958`: `feat: New Task form on Lux Command Center Tasks tab` — 1 file, +124 / −1
- What worked
  - **Reusing existing CSS classes/vars instead of inventing new ones.** The form took zero brand-design decisions because the SalesOS filter pattern (`var(--surface-2)` background, DM Mono, gold focus) was already in the file. Saved a back-and-forth and ensured the form looks native at first paint
  - **Single fetch serves both consumers.** `loadTasks()` already fetched `/projects` to render the project name column in the table — extending it to also populate the form's dropdown means there's no second network call on Tasks-tab load and no race between table render and dropdown render. The dropdown always shows the same project set the table is rendering names from
  - **Heredoc + `--data-binary @file.json`** (CLAUDE.md gotcha #5) for the curl POST simulation — got HTTP 200 first try where standard `-d` quoting would have been mangled by Windows bash and returned 422
  - **Coercing empty `deadline` and `notes` to `null` client-side** — preserves consistency with existing rows where these fields are `null` rather than `""`. The dashboard's `dl()` deadline renderer treats both as falsy so functionally equivalent, but the JSON is cleaner
- Blockers / caveats
  - **Visual end-to-end test deferred to Alan.** Cannot click a browser form from CLI — the form's static markup, JS handlers, and POST round-trip are all individually verified, but only Alan loading `localhost:8081` → Tasks tab → filling the form → submitting will catch any browser-side render or event bug. Most likely failure modes if any: (a) form layout overflow on narrow viewports (the 3-col `task-form-row` grid has no media queries), (b) `<input type="date">` styling differs across browsers, (c) script syntax error caught only at parse — but this file is plain JS, not JSX, so (c) is unlikely
  - **Backend `id` collision risk.** `POST /tasks` generates `id = f"task-{n:03d}"` where `n = len(tasks) + 1`. If any task in tasks.json was previously deleted via `DELETE /tasks/{id}`, the next POST could collide with an existing id. Out of scope for this work. The new form does not add any DELETE — Alan still triages via the existing Complete/Reopen buttons or via direct JSON edit
  - **`task-011` test record left in tasks.json** — title prefixed `TEST:` and notes self-document as safe to delete. Alan can `curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/tasks/task-011` after visual confirmation, or leave it as evidence the wire works
  - **Session-close checklist relies on `:8000` being up** for the dashboard route. Fallback to direct JSON edit is documented in the checklist for the case where the server is down
- Next step
  - Alan: load `localhost:8081`, click Tasks tab, scroll to the New Task panel above the task list. Fill in a real task and submit — confirm (a) the row appears in the table immediately with the right priority badge color, (b) the project name renders correctly in the Project column, (c) the green confirmation message shows the new id. If anything breaks at render time, ping with browser console output
  - Once visual test passes, delete `task-011` (`curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/tasks/task-011`) or leave it as evidence the wire works
  - Adopt the session-close checklist from this point forward — every session close should leave tasks.json + projects.json in a state that reflects what actually happened in the session
- Session close (2026-05-01)
  - **Visual test PASSED** — Alan loaded `localhost:8081` → Tasks tab, filled the form, submitted; row rendered correctly with priority badge + project name + green confirmation. Form working end-to-end.
  - **Smoke task `task-011` deleted** via `curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/tasks/task-011` → `{"ok":true}` HTTP 200. tasks.json state confirmed: task-011 absent.
  - **Real form-test task `task-012` remains** in tasks.json — Alan's manual form submission during the visual test. Living evidence of the wire.
  - **`push_handoff.py` fired cleanly** — 7,111 chars written to handoff_doc (`1MOvSzYF7iV0tEICRJfforTIojYigryi6MOFDpako5xQ`) on Drive. Step 4 of the new §4 session-close checklist satisfied first time it was used.
  - **Final commits this session.** lux-os: `0d14134` (digest reconcile) + `5bf8958` (New Task form). alan-os: `6d9ff5a` (digest reconcile session log) + `0d4d150` (CLAUDE.md §4 + form session log) + this closeout commit.

## 2026-05-01 PM Groups 5-7 rerun + cache-analysis correction
- What was done
  - **Re-ran the full 20-URL Groups 5-7 batch through `yt_transcribe.py`** as Alan directed: 4 HIGH PRIORITY synchronously (one URL per process, single-URL code path → no ThreadPool) followed by a 16-URL remainder batch at `--max-workers 4`. URLs source: `workflows/vie_groups567_urls.txt`. Created the remainder file `workflows/vie_groups567_remainder16_urls.txt` (16 URLs) for the parallel run. Per-URL JSON outputs saved in `workflows/vie_g567_*.json` for the 4 HIGH; combined `workflows/vie_g567_remainder16_results.json` for the remainder
  - **Tool clarification.** Alan's directive said "remaining 16 via orchestrator_v2.py parallel" — but `orchestrator_v2.py` is the generic agent decomposer (reads `DIRECTIVE.md`, dispatches agents from `agents/*.md`); it cannot process URLs. Used `yt_transcribe.py --max-workers 4` (the actual parallel URL runner — same `ThreadPoolExecutor` model that ORCH-2 uses). Flagged the discrepancy in-channel before running so Alan can correct if literal ORCH-2 wrapping was intended
  - **All 19 successful URLs returned `dedup: true` from `/ai_stack`.** Prior commit `099e2df` ("feat(VIE-yt): Groups 5-7 batch results") had already processed and posted these URLs. The fresh Claude evals from this session were captured in the JSON outputs but the server kept the older records. Verdicts on the fresh evals match the prior session's verdicts: **0 ADOPT / 0 EVALUATE / 1 MONITOR / 18 REJECT / 1 ERROR**
  - **1 ERROR** — `youtube.com/shorts/4nXxY_AaXuY` failed metadata extraction with `WARNING: [youtube] No supported JavaScript runtime could be found. Only deno is enabled by default; YouTube extraction without a JS runtime has been deprecated.` yt-dlp 2026.03.17 requires a JS runtime for some YouTube formats. Retried standalone — same failure. 19/20 URLs evaluated; 1 deferred to next session
  - **Corrected the cache anomaly diagnosis in STACK_DESIGN.md §2.C and §5.** The prior commit `099e2df` claimed "SDK 0.94.0 simply isn't surfacing cache fields in `msg.usage`, regardless of call shape" — based on observing `cache_write=0` across all 20 calls. My rerun shows different data: `cache_write` DID fire in the SDK on ~7/20 calls with real values (HIGH 2: 2247, HIGH 4: 2297; remainder batch: 11,791 total). The SDK reports cache_write correctly; the persistent issue is `cache_read=0` on every call. Refined hypothesis: per-node prompt cache routing — cache writes succeed but each request lands on a different node, so reads never hit. Cost-savings rationale of `cache_control: ephemeral` is currently unrealized. Defer investigation; functional behavior unaffected. Documented in §2.C cache paragraph + §5 caching bullet
- What worked
  - **Pre-flight checks before running 20 API calls.** Confirmed `localhost:8000/ai_stack` returned 200, `yt-dlp 2026.03.17` present at expected path, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` line present in `~/.lux/.env`. No surprises during the runs
  - **Sequential single-URL `python yt_transcribe.py <url>` calls for the 4 HIGH PRIORITY** — `yt_transcribe.py` line 443 takes the no-ThreadPool path when `len(urls) == 1`, giving truly synchronous per-URL execution without needing `--max-workers 1`. Cleaner than passing four URLs as positional args (which would have used the default ThreadPool) and easier to capture per-URL JSON via `--out`
  - **Reading the prior commit's narrative before overwriting.** When my Edit failed with "file modified since read," I re-Read the doc and discovered commit `099e2df` had already written §2.C with most of the verdict content. Avoided clobbering — switched to surgical Edits on the two paragraphs where my fresh data contradicted the prior conclusion (cache analysis only)
- Blockers / caveats
  - **Caching anomaly remains unresolved**, but root cause is now better understood (per-node routing, not SDK reporting bug). To verify the per-node hypothesis: instrument a test that sends the same system prompt twice in quick succession from a single long-lived `anthropic.Anthropic` client and inspect whether `cache_read_input_tokens > 0` on the second call. If yes, then the `yt_transcribe.py` per-batch client model is the bottleneck. If no, then it's truly per-node and Anthropic's cache distribution is the issue. Defer until cache costs become material — Sonnet 4.6 base rates make this batch's full cost ~$0.28
  - **`4nXxY_AaXuY` deferred.** yt-dlp's JS-runtime requirement is upstream-deprecation; the fix needs Deno installed and `--js-runtimes deno:<path>` wired into `get_video_metadata()`/`get_transcript()` subprocess invocations. Three options exist (install Deno, pin yt-dlp to pre-deprecation version, accept graceful skip). Not blocking — the batch processed 19/20 — but failure rate will increase as YouTube tightens scraping
  - **Tool-name discrepancy in directive.** "orchestrator_v2.py parallel" was the user's phrase; substituted `yt_transcribe.py --max-workers 4` because ORCH-2 doesn't process URLs. Future directives could be unambiguous if they say "yt_transcribe parallel" or "ORCH-2 wrapping" explicitly. Not changing anything in CLAUDE.md — this is a one-off observation
- Next step
  - **Add deno install + `--js-runtimes deno:<path>` wiring** to `yt_transcribe.py` subprocess invocations next session — unblocks the single failing URL and future-proofs against more YouTube format extractions losing direct compatibility
  - **Cache investigation (deferred):** test single-process long-lived client with rapid same-prompt calls to verify per-node hypothesis. Would unlock ~80% cost savings on batches if fixed. Not material at current ~$0.28/batch volume
  - **Watch list unchanged** — no new MONITOR or EVALUATE additions from this rerun (verdicts match prior session). The Jake Van Clief ordered-skill-file pattern (`LXB_dBvDSOE`, the lone MONITOR) re-eval gate still requires a code repo or independent benchmark
- Session close (2026-05-01 PM)
  - **Reported plan in-channel before executing** — flagged the `orchestrator_v2.py` → `yt_transcribe.py` substitution and the dedup discovery early so Alan could redirect if needed
  - **STACK_DESIGN.md §2.C cache paragraph + §5 caching bullet corrected** — fresh observed data (`cache_write` non-zero on 2/4 HIGH and 11,791 in remainder batch) replaces the prior "SDK not surfacing" conclusion with the per-node-routing hypothesis
  - Commits this session: see HEAD on alan-os after this entry lands
